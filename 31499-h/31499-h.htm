<h1>The Camp Fire Girls<br />At the Seashore</h1>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span><a id='link_1'></a>CHAPTER I<br /><span class='h2fs'>FROM THE ASHES</span></h2>

<p>The sun rose over Plum Beach to shine down on a scene of confusion and
wreckage that might have caused girls less determined and courageous than those
who belonged to the Manasquan Camp Fire of the Camp Fire Girls of America to
feel that there was only one thing to do&#8211;pack up and move away. But,
though the camp itself was in ruins, there were no signs of discouragement among
the girls themselves. Merry laughter vied with the sound of the waves, and the
confusion among the girls was more apparent than real.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you got everything sorted, Margery&#8211;the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span> things that are completely ruined and
those that are worth saving?&#8221; asked Eleanor Mercer, the Guardian of the
Camp Fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and there&#8217;s more here that we can save and still use than
anyone would have dreamed just after we got the fire put out,&#8221; replied
Margery Burton, one of the older girls, who was a Fire-Maker. In the Camp Fire
there are three ranks&#8211;the Wood-Gatherers, to which all girls belong when
they join; the Fire-Makers, next in order, and, finally, the Torch-Bearers, of
which Manasquan Camp Fire had none. These rank next to the Guardian in a Camp
Fire, and, as a rule, there is only one in each Camp Fire. She is a sort of
assistant to the Guardian, and, as the name of the rank implies, she is supposed
to hand on the light of what the Camp Fire has given her, by becoming a Guardian
of a new Camp Fire as soon as she is qualified.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s next?&#8221; cried Bessie King, who had been working with
some of the other girls in sorting out the things which could be used, despite
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span> the damage done by
the fire that had almost wiped out the camp during the night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, we&#8217;ll start a fire of our own!&#8221; said Eleanor.
&#8220;There&#8217;s no sort of use in keeping any of this rubbish, and the best
way to get rid of it is just to burn it. All hands to work now, piling it up and
seeing that there is a good draught underneath, so that it will burn up. We can
get rid of ashes easily, but half-burned things are a nuisance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are we going to sleep to-night?&#8221; asked Dolly Ransom,
ruefully surveying the places where the tents had stood. Only two remained,
which were used for sleeping quarters by some of the girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m more bothered about what we&#8217;re going to eat,&#8221;
said Eleanor, with a laugh. &#8220;Do you realize that we&#8217;ve been so
excited that we haven&#8217;t had any breakfast? I should think you&#8217;d be
starved, Dolly. You&#8217;ve had a busier morning than the rest of us,
even.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I <i>am</i> hungry, when I&#8217;m reminded of it,&#8221; said <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span> Dolly, with, a comical
gesture. &#8220;What ever are we going to do, Miss Eleanor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just teasing you, Dolly,&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;Mr.
Salters came over from Green Cove in his boat, when he saw the fire, to see if
he couldn&#8217;t help in some way, and he&#8217;s gone in to Bay City.
He&#8217;ll be out pretty soon with a load of provisions, and as many other
things as he can stuff into the <i>Sally S</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we&#8217;re really going to stay here?&#8221; said Bessie
King.</p>

<p>&#8220;We certainly are!&#8221; said Eleanor, her eyes flashing. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t see why we should let a little thing like this fire drive us away!
We are going to stay here, and, what&#8217;s more, we&#8217;re going to have
just as good a time as we planned to have when we came here&#8211;if not a
better one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; cried half a dozen of the girls together.</p>

<p>Soon all the rubbish was collected, and a fire had been built. And, while
Margery Burton applied a light to it, the girls formed a circle about <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span> it, and danced around,
singing the while the most popular of Camp Fire songs, Wo-he-lo.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s like turning all the unpleasant things that have happened
to us, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;We just toss them into the
flames, and they&#8217;re gone! What&#8217;s left is clean and good and useful,
and we will make all the better use of it for having lost what is burning
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it strange, Miss Eleanor,&#8221; said Bessie King,
&#8220;that this should have happened to us so soon after the fire that burned
up the Pratt&#8217;s farm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it is,&#8221; replied Eleanor. &#8220;And there&#8217;s a lesson
in it for us, just as there was for them in their fire. We didn&#8217;t expect
to find them in such trouble when we started to walk there, but we were able to
help them, and to show them that there was a way of rising from the ruin of
their home, and being happier and more prosperous than they had been
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to do that, too,&#8221; said Dolly, with spirit.
&#8220;I felt terrible when I first saw the place <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span> in the light, after the fire was all out,
but it looks different already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Salters will be here soon,&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;And now
there&#8217;s nothing more to do until he comes. We&#8217;ll have a fine
meal&#8211;and if you&#8217;re half as hungry as I am you&#8217;ll be glad of
that&#8211;and we&#8217;ll spend the afternoon in getting the place to rights.
But just now the best thing for all of us to do is to rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be glad to do that,&#8221; said Dolly Ransom, as she linked
her arm with Bessie&#8217;s and drew her away. &#8220;I am pretty
tired.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think you would be, Dolly. I haven&#8217;t had a chance to
thank you yet for what you did for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, nonsense, Bessie!&#8221; said Dolly, flushing. &#8220;You&#8217;d
have done it for me, wouldn&#8217;t you? I&#8217;m only just as glad as I can be
that I was able to do anything to get you away from Mr. Holmes&#8211;you and
Zara.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Zara&#8217;s gone to pieces completely, Dolly. She was terribly
frightened&#8211;more than I was, I think, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_17'></a>17</span> and yet I don&#8217;t see how that can be, because I
was as frightened as I think anyone could have been.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw them get hold of you at all, Bessie. How did it
happen?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s pretty hard to say, Dolly. You know, after we found
out that that yacht was here just to watch us, I was nervous, and so were
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think we had reason to be nervous, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say so! Well, anyhow, as soon as I saw that the tents were on
fire, I was sure that the men on the yacht had had something to do with it. But,
of course, there wasn&#8217;t anything to do but try as hard as I could to help
put out the fire, and it was so exciting that I didn&#8217;t think about any
other danger until I saw a man from the boat that had come ashore pick Zara up
and start to carry her out to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They pretended to be helping us with the fire, and they really did
help, Bessie. I guess we wouldn&#8217;t have saved any of the tents at all if it
hadn&#8217;t been for them.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>&#8220;Oh, I saw
what they were doing! When I saw the man pick Zara up, though, I knew right away
what their plan was. And I was just going to scream when another man got hold of
me, and he kept me from shouting, and carried me off to the yacht in the boat.
Zara had fainted, and they kept us down below in a cabin and said they were
going to take us along the coast until we came to the coast of the state Zara
and I were in when we met you girls first.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We guessed that, Bessie. That was one of the things we were all
worrying about when we came here&#8211;that they might try to carry you two off
that way. I don&#8217;t see how it can be that you&#8217;re all right as long as
you&#8217;re in this state, and in danger as soon as you go back to the one you
came from.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you see, Zara and I really did run away, I suppose. Zara&#8217;s
father is in prison, so they said she had to have a guardian, and I left the
Hoovers. So that old Farmer Weeks&#8211;you know about him, don&#8217;t
you?&#8211;is our guardian in that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_19'></a>19</span> state, and he&#8217;s got an order from the judge
near Hedgeville putting us in his care until we are twenty-one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But that order&#8217;s no good in this state?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, because here Miss Mercer is our guardian. But if they can get us
into that other state, no matter how, they can hold us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I see! And, of course, Miss Eleanor understood right away. When we
told the men who had helped us with the fire that you were missing, they said
they were afraid you must have been caught in the fire, but Miss Eleanor said
she was sure you were on the yacht. And they just laughed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard that big man, Jeff, talking to her when she went aboard the
yacht.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. They wouldn&#8217;t let her look for you, and he threatened to
put her off if she didn&#8217;t come ashore. You heard that, didn&#8217;t
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes! Zara and I could hear everything she said when she was in the
cabin on the yacht. But we couldn&#8217;t let her know where we were.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>&#8220;Well, just
as soon as she could get to a telephone, Miss Eleanor called up Bay City, and
asked them to send policemen or some sort of officers who could search the
yacht. But we were terribly afraid that they would sail away before those men
could get here, and then, you see, we couldn&#8217;t have done a thing. There
wouldn&#8217;t have been any way of catching them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they&#8217;d have done it, too, if it hadn&#8217;t been for you,
Dolly! I don&#8217;t see how you ever thought of it, and how you were brave
enough to do what you did when you did think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pshaw, Bessie&#8211;it was easy! I knew enough about yachts to
understand that if their screw was twisted up with rope it wouldn&#8217;t turn,
and that would keep them there for a little while, anyhow. And they never seemed
to think of that possibility at all. So I swam out there, and, of course, I
could dive and stay down for a few seconds at a time. It was easier, because I
had something to hold on to.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span>&#8220;It was
mighty clever, and mighty plucky of you, too, Dolly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was only one thing I regretted, Bessie. I wish I&#8217;d been
able to hear what they said when they found out they couldn&#8217;t get
away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish you&#8217;d been there, too, Dolly,&#8221; said Bessie,
laughing. &#8220;They were perfectly furious, and everyone on board blamed
everyone else. It took them quite a while to find out what was the matter, and
then even after they found out, it meant a long delay before they could clear
the screw and get moving.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never was so glad of anything in my life, Bessie, as when we saw the
men from Bay City coming while that yacht was still here! We kept watching it
all the time, of course, and we saw them send the sailor over to dive down and
find out what was wrong. Then we could see him going down and coming up, time
after time, and it seemed as if he would get it done in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been exciting, Dolly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it was just as exciting for you, wasn&#8217;t <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span> it? But it would have been
dreadful if, after having held them so long, it hadn&#8217;t been quite long
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it <i>was</i> long enough, Dolly, thanks to you! I hate to think
of where I would be now if you hadn&#8217;t managed it so cleverly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will they do to those men on the yacht, do you
suppose?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Miss Eleanor wants to prove that it was Mr. Holmes
who got them to do it, I think. But that won&#8217;t be decided until her
cousin, Mr. Jamieson, the lawyer, comes. He&#8217;ll know what we&#8217;d better
do, and I&#8217;m sure Miss Eleanor will leave it to him to decide.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you one thing, Bessie. This sort of persecution of you and Zara
has got to be stopped. I really do believe they&#8217;ve gone too far this time.
Of course, if they had got you away, they&#8217;d have been all right, because
in that other state where you two came from what they did was all right. But
they got caught at it. I certainly do hope <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_23'></a>23</span> that Mr. Jamieson will be able to find some way to
stop them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad we&#8217;re going to stay here, aren&#8217;t you,
Dolly? Do you know, I really feel that we&#8217;ll be safer here now than if we
went somewhere else? They&#8217;ve tried their best to get at us here, and they
couldn&#8217;t manage it. Perhaps now they&#8217;ll think that we&#8217;ll be on
our guard too much, and leave us alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so, Bessie. But look here, there were two girls on guard last
night, and what good did it do us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t think they were asleep, do you, Dolly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m sure they weren&#8217;t. But they just didn&#8217;t have
a chance to do anything. What happened was this. Margery and Mary were sitting
back to back, so that one could watch the yacht and the other the path that
leads up to the spring on top of the bluff, where those two men we had seen were
sitting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was a good idea, Dolly.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>&#8220;First rate,
but those people were too clever. They didn&#8217;t row ashore in a
boat&#8211;not here, at least. And no one came down the path, until later,
anyhow. The first thing that made Margery think there was anything wrong was
when she smelt smoke and then, a second later, the big living tent was all
ablaze.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It might have been an accident, Dolly, I suppose&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, it might have been, but it wasn&#8217;t! They were here too
soon, and it fitted in too well with their plans. Miss Eleanor thinks she knows
how they started the fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how could they have done that, if there were none of them here on
the beach, Dolly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She says that if they were on the bluff, above the tents, they could
very easily have thrown down bombs that would smoulder, and soon set the canvas
on fire. And there was a high wind last night, and it wouldn&#8217;t have taken
long, once a spark had touched the canvas, for everything to blaze up. They
couldn&#8217;t have picked a much better night.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>&#8220;I
don&#8217;t suppose that can be proved, though, Dolly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid not. That&#8217;s what Miss Eleanor says, too. She
says you can often be so sure of a thing yourself that it seems that it must
have happened, without being able to prove it to someone else. That&#8217;s
where they are so clever, and that&#8217;s what makes them so dangerous. They
can hide their tracks splendidly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why men who can do such things couldn&#8217;t keep
straight, and really make more money honestly than they can by being
crooked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does seem strange, doesn&#8217;t it, Bessie? Oh, look,
there&#8217;s the <i>Sally S.</i> with our breakfast&#8211;and there&#8217;s
another boat coming in. I wonder if Mr. Jamieson can be here already?&#8221;</p>

<p>In a moment his voice proved that it <i>was</i> possible, and a few minutes
later, while the girls were helping Captain Salters to unload the stores he had
brought with him, Eleanor was greeting her attorney from Bay City.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you haven&#8217;t met Billy Trenwith properly yet,
Eleanor,&#8221; said Charlie Jamieson, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe not,&#8221; said Eleanor, returning the smile, &#8220;but I
regard him as a friend already, Charlie. He was splendid this morning. If he
hadn&#8217;t understood so quickly, and acted at once, the way he did, I
don&#8217;t know what would have happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I didn&#8217;t really understand at all, Miss
Mercer,&#8221; said Trenwith, a good looking young fellow, with light brown hair
and grey blue eyes, that, although mild and pleasant enough now, had been as
cold as steel when Bessie had seen him on the yacht. &#8220;But I could
understand readily enough that you were in trouble, and I knew that
Charlie&#8217;s cousin wouldn&#8217;t appeal to me <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span> unless there was a good reason. So I
didn&#8217;t feel that I was taking many chances in doing what you
wished.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid you took more chances than you know about,
Billy,&#8221; said Charlie, gravely. &#8220;You&#8217;re in politics,
aren&#8217;t you? And you have ambitions for more of a job than you&#8217;ve got
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;m in politics, after a fashion,&#8221; admitted
Trenwith. &#8220;But I guess I could manage to keep alive if I never got another
political office. I had a bit of a practice before I became district attorney,
and I think I could build it up again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope this isn&#8217;t going to make any difference, Billy. But
it&#8217;s only fair for you to know the sort of game you&#8217;re running into.
I don&#8217;t want to feel that you&#8217;re going ahead to help us without
understanding the situation just as it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You talk as if this might be a pretty complicated bit of business,
Charlie. Suppose you loosen up and tell me about it. Then I may be able to
figure better on how I can help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I&#8217;m going to do, old man. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span> I want you to meet two of
cousin&#8217;s protegees here&#8211;Bessie King and Zara, the mysterious. If we
knew more about Zara and her affairs this wouldn&#8217;t be such a Chinese
puzzle. But here goes! Ask me all the questions you like. And you girls&#8211;if
I go wrong, stop me.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place, Miss Mercer here took a party of her Camp Fire
Girls, these same ones that you can see there so busy about getting breakfast,
over the state line, and they went to a camp on a lake a little way from a
village called Hedgeville.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know the place,&#8221; nodded Trenwith. &#8220;Never been there, but
I know where it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, one morning they discovered these two&#8211;Bessie and Zara. And
they&#8217;d had a strange experience. They were running away!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bad business, as a rule,&#8221; commented Trenwith. &#8220;But I
suppose there was a good reason?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet there was, old chap! Bessie had lived for a good many years
with an old farmer called Hoover and his wife. They had a son, too, a <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span> worthless young scamp
named Jake, lazy and ready for any sort of mischief that turned up!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is she related to them in any way, Charlie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it! When she was a little bit of a kid her parents left
her there as a boarder, and they were supposed to send money to pay for her keep
until they came back to get her. For a while they did, but then the money
stopped coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But they kept her on, just the same?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, as a sort of unpaid servant. She did all the work she could
manage, and she didn&#8217;t have a very good time. Zara, here, has a father.
How long ago did Zara and her father come to Hedgeville, Bessie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;d been there about two years when we&#8211;we had to run
away, Mr. Jamieson. They came from some foreign country, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And the people around Hedgeville couldn&#8217;t make much out
about them, so they decided, of course, being unable to understand them, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span> that there must be
something wrong about Zara&#8217;s dad. No real reason at all, except that he
only spoke a little English, and liked to keep his business to
himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trenwith laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I see a lot of that sort of
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the day before the two of them ran away&#8211;or the day before
they found the girls, rather&#8211;there&#8217;d been a fine shindy at the
Hoovers. Zara went over to see Bessie, and Jake Hoover locked her in a tool
shed. Then he managed, without meaning to do it, to set the tool shed afire, and
said he was going to say that Bessie had done it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fine young pup, he must be!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8211;worth knowing! Anyhow, Bessie had only too good reason to
know that his mother would believe him and take his word, no matter what she and
Zara said. So, being scared, she just ran. I don&#8217;t blame her! I&#8217;d
have done the same thing myself. You and I both know that <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span> knowing he&#8217;s innocent doesn&#8217;t
keep a man who is unjustly accused from being afraid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Trenwith, thoughtfully. &#8220;I&#8217;ve had to learn
that it doesn&#8217;t pay to think a man&#8217;s guilty because he&#8217;s
scared and confused. It&#8217;s an old theory that innocence shows in a
prisoner&#8217;s eyes, and it&#8217;s very pretty&#8211;only it isn&#8217;t
true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, even so, they might not have run away if it hadn&#8217;t
happened that that was the day Zara&#8217;s father was arrested. Apparently with
an old miser and money lender called Weeks as the moving spirit, a charge of
counterfeiting was cooked up against him, and they took him off to my town to
jail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s in another state!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;United States case, you see. My town&#8217;s the centre of the Federal
district. Zara and Bessie happened to get on to this, and when they crept up to
Zara&#8217;s house to find out if it was true, they overheard enough to show
them that it was&#8211;and, what was more, that old Weeks meant to get <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span> himself appointed
Zara&#8217;s guardian, and take her home with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that was his game, eh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and if you&#8217;d ever seen him, you wouldn&#8217;t blame Zara
for being ready to run away before she went with him. He&#8217;s the meanest old
codger you ever saw. But he had a big pull in that region, because he held
mortgages on about all the farms, and he could do about as he liked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t see why they didn&#8217;t have a perfect right to
run away,&#8221; said Trenwith, &#8220;legally and morally. They didn&#8217;t
owe anything in the way of gratitude to any of these people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I said!&#8221; declared Eleanor, vehemently.
&#8220;I looked into the story they told me, and I found out it was perfectly
true. So we helped them, and took them into this state.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. And old Weeks chased them, and got Zara away from them once.
Bessie tricked him and got her back,&#8221; said Jamieson. &#8220;And then the
old rip got a court order making him Zara&#8217;s guardian, but he tried to
serve it across the state <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_34'></a>34</span> line, and got dished for his trouble. So it looked as
if they&#8217;d shaken him pretty well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say so! Do you mean that he kept it up after that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He certainly did! And he got pretty powerful help too. Here&#8217;s
where the part of it that ought to interest you really begins. Miss Mercer took
the two girls home with her, and almost at once, in the middle of the night,
Zara was spirited away. At first we thought she&#8217;d been kidnapped but later
it turned out that she&#8217;d been deceived, and gone with them
willingly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is beginning to sound pretty exciting, Charlie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I got interested in the case, Billy, and I tried to do what I could
for Zara&#8217;s father. He didn&#8217;t trust me much, and I had a dickens of a
time persuading him to talk. And then, just as I was about on the point of
succeeding, he shut up like a clam, fired me as his lawyer, and hired Isaac
Brack!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That little shyster? Good Heavens!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>&#8220;Right!
Well, she&#8211;Zara, I mean&#8211;seemed to have vanished into thin air. We
couldn&#8217;t get any trace of her at all, until Bessie here dug up a wild idea
that it was in Morton Holmes&#8217;s car she&#8217;d been taken off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Holmes, the big dry goods merchant?&#8221; said Trenwith, with a
laugh. &#8220;How in the world did she ever get such a wild idea as that? He
wouldn&#8217;t be mixed up in anything shady!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what we told her,&#8221; said Charlie, unsmilingly, &#8220;but
she insisted she was right. And, a little while later, after Miss Mercer had
taken the girls to her father&#8217;s farm, Holmes came along, tricked her into
getting in his car with another girl, and ran them over the state line. He met
Weeks and this Jake Hoover&#8211;but Bessie was too smart for them, and got back
over the state line safely. And the same day, putting two and two together, I
found Zara, held a prisoner in an old house that Holmes had bought!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Lord!&#8221; said Trenwith, blankly. &#8220;So Holmes had been in
it from the start?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>&#8220;I
don&#8217;t know how long he&#8217;s been mixed up in it, but he was in it then,
with both feet. He was hand in glove with old Weeks, and for some reason he was
mighty anxious to get both the girls across the state line and into old
Weeks&#8217;s care as guardian appointed by one of their courts over
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why, Charlie&#8211;why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I knew. I&#8217;ve been cudgelling my brains for weeks to get
the answer to that question, Billy. It&#8217;s kept me awake nights, and
I&#8217;m no nearer to it now than I was at the beginning. But hold on, you
haven&#8217;t heard it all yet, by a good deal!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What? Do you mean they weren&#8217;t content with that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so that you could notice it, they weren&#8217;t! The girls went to
Long Lake, up in the woods, and while they were there, a gypsy tried to carry
them off. He mixed them up a bit, and, partly by good luck, and partly by
Bessie&#8217;s good nerve and pluck, he was caught and landed in jail at
Hamilton, the county seat up there.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>&#8220;Was Holmes
mixed up in that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He&#8217;d been fool enough to write a letter to the gypsy, and
sign his own name to it. He hired lawyers to defend the gypsy, too, but that
letter smashed his case, and the gypsy went to jail. They were afraid of Holmes,
though, at Hamilton and we couldn&#8217;t touch him. He&#8217;s got a whole lot
of money and power, too, especially in politics. So he can get away with things
that would land a smaller man in jail in a jiffy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His money and pull won&#8217;t do him any good down here,&#8221; said
Trenwith, his eyes snapping. &#8220;Have you any reason to think he was mixed up
in this outrage here this morning and last night, Charlie?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every reason to think so, Billy, but mighty little proof to back up
what I think. There&#8217;s the rub. Still&#8211;well, we&#8217;ll see what we
see later. I&#8217;ll give you some of the reasons.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better,&#8221; said Trenwith, grimly. &#8220;I think
it&#8217;s pretty nearly time for me to take a hand in this.&#8221; He shot a
look at Eleanor that <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
Bessie did not fail to notice. Evidently her charms had already made an
impression on him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yesterday, when Miss Mercer brought the girls down to Bay City from
Windsor,&#8221; Jamieson went on, &#8220;the train was to stop for a minute at
Canton, which, though they had none of them thought of it, is in Weeks&#8217;s
state. And Bessie happened to discover that Jake Hoover was spying on them. She
stayed behind the others at Windsor, discovered that he was telegraphing the
news to Holmes, and guessed the plot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good for her!&#8221; exclaimed Trenwith.</p>

<p>&#8220;So she got a message through to Miss Mercer on the train, and, being
warned, Zara was able to elude the people who searched the train for her at
Canton. Bessie went on a later train that didn&#8217;t stop at Canton at all, so
they were all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That looks like pretty good evidence,&#8221; said Trenwith, frowning.
&#8220;He knew they were coming here and he&#8217;d made one attempt to get hold
of them on the way.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>&#8220;Yes, and
there&#8217;s more. When this yacht turned up here last night, Miss Mercer and
the girls were nervous. And Bessie and her chum Dolly Ransom happened to
overhear two men who were put at the top of that bluff to watch the camp. They
talked about the &#8216;boss&#8217; and how he meant to get those girls and had been
&#8216;stung once too often.&#8217; But they didn&#8217;t mention Holmes by
name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad. Still, that fire was too timely to have been accidental. I
think maybe we can convict them of starting it. Then if these fellows think
they&#8217;re in danger of going to prison, we might offer them a chance of
liberty if they confess and implicate Holmes, do you see?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be a good bargain, Billy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I think. I&#8217;d let the tool escape any time to
get hold of the man who was using him. They and the yacht are held safely at Bay
City, in any case, and we have plenty of time to decide what&#8217;s best to be
done there.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span>&#8220;If I know
Holmes, he&#8217;ll show you his hand pretty soon, Bill. I believe he thinks
that every man has his price, and he probably has an idea that he can get you on
his side if he works it right and offers you enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s got several more thinks coming on that,&#8221; said
Trenwith, angrily. &#8220;What a hound he must be! We&#8217;ve got to get to the
bottom of this business, Charlie. That&#8217;s all there is to it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t Jake Hoover help, Charlie?&#8221; suggested Eleanor.
&#8220;He told Bessie he would go in to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He did come, but I was called away, and meant to talk to him again
this morning, Nell. Then of course I had to come down here when I got this news
from you and so I didn&#8217;t have a chance. But I may get something out of him
yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve decided, Mr. Trenwith,&#8221; Eleanor explained,
&#8220;that the reason Jake is doing just what they want is that he&#8217;s
afraid of them&#8211;that they know of some wrong thing he has done, and have
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span> been threatening to
expose him if he doesn&#8217;t obey them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if they&#8217;re scaring him,&#8221; said Charlie, &#8220;the
thing for us to do is to scare him worse than they can. He&#8217;ll stick to the
side he&#8217;s most afraid of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s get him down here,&#8221; said Trenwith. &#8220;Then we
can not only handle him better, but we can keep an eye on him. I&#8217;m with
you in this, Charlie, for anything I can do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good man!&#8221; said Charlie. &#8220;Then you&#8217;re not afraid of
Holmes? He&#8217;s pretty powerful, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trenwith looked at Eleanor. And when he saw the smile she gave him, and her
look of liking and of confidence, he laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess I can look after myself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;No, I&#8217;m
not afraid of him, old man! We&#8217;ll fight this out together.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span><a id='link_3'></a>CHAPTER III<br /><span class='h2fs'>AN UNEXPECTED REUNION</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;I like that Mr. Trenwith, Bessie,&#8221; said Dolly, when the meal was
over and she and Bessie were working together. They usually managed to arrange
their work so that they could be together at it.</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I, Dolly. He doesn&#8217;t seem to be a bit afraid of Mr.
Holmes, and I do believe he will help Mr. Jamieson an awful lot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he&#8217;ll need help, all right,&#8221; said Dolly, gravely.
&#8220;The more I think about that fire, the more scared I get. Why, how did
those wretches know that some of us wouldn&#8217;t be hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess they didn&#8217;t, Dolly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then they simply didn&#8217;t care, that&#8217;s all. And isn&#8217;t
that dreadful, Bessie? The idea of doing such a thing!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish we knew why they did it, or why Mr. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span> Holmes wants them to do such things.
It&#8217;s easy enough to see why <i>they</i> did it&#8211;they wanted the money
he had promised to pay if they got Zara and me away from here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember what I told you. Mr. Holmes expects to make a lot of
money out of you two, in some fashion. I know you laughed at me when I said that
before, and said he had so much money already that that couldn&#8217;t be the
reason. But there simply can&#8217;t be any other, Bessie; that&#8217;s all
there is to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie sighed wearily.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish it was all over,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Sometimes I&#8217;m
sorry they haven&#8217;t caught me and taken me back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Bessie, that&#8217;s an awful thing for you to say! Don&#8217;t
you want to be with us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I do, Dolly! I&#8217;ve never been so happy in my whole life
as I have been since that morning when I saw you girls for the first time. But I
hate to think of the trouble my staying makes, and when I think that maybe
there&#8217;s <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span> danger
for the rest of you, as there was last night&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about that, Bessie! I guess we can stand it if
you can. That&#8217;s what friends are for&#8211;to share your troubles. You
mustn&#8217;t get to feeling that way&#8211;it&#8217;s silly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it doesn&#8217;t make much difference, Dolly. I don&#8217;t seem
to be able to help it. But I wish it was all over. And do you know what worries
me most of all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. What?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what that nasty lawyer, Isaac Brack, said to me one time. Do you
remember my telling you? That unless I went with him, and did what he and his
friends wanted, I&#8217;d never find out about my father and my
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe it, Bessie! I don&#8217;t believe he knows
anything at all about them, and I don&#8217;t believe, either, that that&#8217;s
the only way you&#8217;ll ever hear anything about them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it might be true!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come on, Bessie, cheer up! You&#8217;re going <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span> to be all right. And I&#8217;ll bet that
when you do find out about your parents, and why they left you with Maw Hoover
so long, you&#8217;ll be glad you had to wait so long, because it will make you
so happy when you do know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then Eleanor&#8217;s voice called the girls together.</p>

<p>&#8220;All hands to work rebuilding the camp,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We want
to have the new tents set up, and everything ready for the night. I&#8217;d like
those people to know, if they come snooping around here again, that it takes
more than a fire to put the Camp Fire Girls out of business!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My, but you&#8217;re a slave driver, Nell,&#8221; said Charlie
Jamieson, jovially. He winked in the direction of Trenwith. &#8220;I&#8217;m
sorry for your husband when you get married. You&#8217;ll keep him busy, all
right!&#8221;</p>

<p>Hearing the remark, Trenwith grinned, while Eleanor flushed. His look said
pretty plainly that he wouldn&#8217;t waste any sympathy on the man lucky enough
to marry Eleanor Mercer, and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_47'></a>47</span> Dolly, catching the look, drew Bessie aside. Her
observation in such matters was amazingly keen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see that?&#8221; she whispered, excitedly. &#8220;Why, Bessie,
I do believe he&#8217;s fallen in love with her already!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I should think he would!&#8221; said Bessie, surprisingly.
&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t think much of any man who didn&#8217;t! She&#8217;s the
nicest girl I ever saw or dreamed of seeing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s all of that,&#8221; agreed Dolly, loyally. &#8220;You
can&#8217;t tell me anything nice about Miss Eleanor that I haven&#8217;t found
out for myself long ago. But Mr. Jamieson isn&#8217;t in love with her&#8211;and
he&#8217;s known her much longer than Mr. Trenwith has.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That hasn&#8217;t got anything at all to do with it,&#8221; declared
Bessie. &#8220;People don&#8217;t have to know one another a long time to fall
in love&#8211;though sometimes they don&#8217;t always know about it themselves
right away. And, besides, I think she and Mr. Jamieson are just like brother and
sister. They&#8217;re only cousins, of course, but they&#8217;ve sort <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span> of grown up together, and
they know one another awfully well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may know more about things like that than I do,&#8221; agreed
Dolly, dubiously. &#8220;But I know this much, anyhow. If I were a man,
I&#8217;d certainly be in love with Miss Eleanor, if I knew her at
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stopped for a moment to look at Eleanor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better not let her catch us whispering about her,&#8221; she went on.
&#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t like it a little bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t a nice thing to do anyhow, Dolly. You&#8217;re
perfectly right. I do think Mr. Trenwith&#8217;s a nice man. Maybe he&#8217;s
good enough for her. But I think I&#8217;ll always like Mr. Jamieson better,
because he&#8217;s been so nice to us from the very start, when he knew that we
couldn&#8217;t pay him, the way people usually do lawyers who work so hard for
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He certainly is a nice man, Bessie. But then so is Mr.
Trenwith.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look out, Dolly!&#8221; cautioned Bessie, with a <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span> low laugh. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be getting
jealous and losing your temper first thing you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess not. Talking about losing one&#8217;s temper, I wonder if
Gladys Cooper is still mad at us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope not! That was sort of funny, wasn&#8217;t it, as well as
unpleasant? Why do you suppose she was so angry, and got the other girls in
their camp at Lake Dean to hating us so much when we first went
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she couldn&#8217;t help it, Bessie, I guess. It&#8217;s the way
she&#8217;s been brought up. Her people have lots of money, and they&#8217;ve
let her think that just because of that she is better than girls whose parents
are poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the rest of them certainly changed their minds about us,
didn&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and it was a fine thing! I guess they realized that we were
better than they thought, when Gladys and Marcia Bates got lost in the woods
that time, and you and I happened to find them, and get them home
safely.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>&#8220;I think
they were mighty nice girls, Dolly&#8211;much nicer than you would ever have
thought they could be from the way they acted when we first met them, and they
ordered us off their ground, just as if we were going to hurt it. When they
found out that they&#8217;d been in the wrong, and hadn&#8217;t behaved nicely,
they said they were sorry, and admitted that they hadn&#8217;t been nice. And I
think that&#8217;s a pretty hard thing for anyone to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it is, Bessie. I know, because I&#8217;ve found out so often that
I&#8217;d been mean to people who were ever so much nicer than I. But
there&#8217;s one thing about it&#8211;it makes you feel sort of good all over
when you have owned up that way. I wish Gladys Cooper had acted like the rest of
them. But she was still mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I think you&#8217;ll find she&#8217;s all right when you see her
again, Dolly. I guess she&#8217;s just as nice as the rest of them,
really.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one reason I&#8217;m sorry she acted that way. Because
she&#8217;s as nice as any girl you ever <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_51'></a>51</span> saw when she wants to be. I was awfully mad at her
when it happened, but now, somehow, I&#8217;ve got over feeling that way about
her, altogether, and I just want to be good friends with her again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You lose your temper pretty quickly, Dolly, but you get over being
angry just as quickly as you get mad, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I seem to, Bessie. And I guess that&#8217;s helping me not to get
angry at people so much, anyhow. I&#8217;m always sorry when I do get into one
of my rages, and if I&#8217;m going to be sorry, it&#8217;s easier not to get
mad in the first place.&#8221;</p>

<p>While they talked, Bessie and Dolly were not idle, by any means. There was
plenty of work for everyone to do, for the fire had made a pretty clean sweep,
after all, and to put the whole camp in good shape, so that they could sleep
there that night, was something of a task.</p>

<p>Trenwith and Jamieson, laughing a good deal, and enjoying themselves
immensely, insisted on doing the heavy work of setting up the ridge poles, and
laying down the floors of the new tents, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_52'></a>52</span> but when it came to stretching the canvas over the
framework, they were not in it with the girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;You men mean well, but I never saw anything so clumsy in my
life!&#8221; declared Eleanor, laughingly. &#8220;It&#8217;s a wonder to me how
you ever come home alive when you go out camping by yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, we manage somehow,&#8221; boasted Charlie Jamieson.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just about what you do do! You manage&#8211;somehow! And,
yet, when this Camp Fire movement started, all the men I knew sat around and
jeered, and said that girls were just jealous of the good times the Boy Scouts
had, and predicted that unless we took men along to look after us, we&#8217;d be
in all sorts of trouble the first time we ever undertook to spend a night in
camp!&#8221;</p>

<p>Charlie shook his head at Trenwith in mock alarm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Getting pretty independent, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221; he said to his
friend. &#8220;You mark my words, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_53'></a>53</span> Billy, the old-fashioned women don&#8217;t exist any
more!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And it&#8217;s a good thing if they don&#8217;t!&#8221; Eleanor
flashed back at him. &#8220;They do, though, only you men don&#8217;t know the
real thing when you see it. You have an idea that a woman ought to be helpless
and clinging. Maybe that was all right in the old days, when there were always
plenty of men to look after a woman. But how about the way things are now? Women
have to go into shops and offices and factories to earn a living, don&#8217;t
they, just the way men do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They do&#8211;more&#8217;s the pity!&#8221; said Trenwith.</p>

<p>Eleanor looked at him as if she understood just what he meant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it isn&#8217;t so much of a pity, though,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I tell you one thing&#8211;a girl isn&#8217;t going to make any the worse
wife for being self-reliant, and knowing how to take care of herself a little
bit. And that&#8217;s what we want to make of our Camp Fire Girls&#8211;girls
who can help themselves if there&#8217;s need for it, and who don&#8217;t need
to have <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span> a man
wasting a lot of time doing things for them that he ought to be spending in
serious work&#8211;things that she can do just as well for herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood before them as she spoke, a splendid figure of youth, and health
and strength. And, as she spoke, she plunged her hand into a capacious pocket in
her skirt.</p>

<p>&#8220;There!&#8221; she said, &#8220;that&#8217;s one of the things that has
kept women helpless. It wasn&#8217;t fashionable to have pockets, so men got one
great advantage just in their clothes. Camp Fire Girls have pockets!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You say that as if it was some sort of a motto,&#8221; said Charlie,
laughing, but impressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is!&#8221; she replied. &#8220;Camp Fire Girls have pockets!
That&#8217;s one of the things you&#8217;ll see in any Camp Fire book you
read&#8211;any of the books that the National Council issues, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I surrender! I&#8217;m converted&#8211;absolutely!&#8221; said
Jamieson, with a laugh. &#8220;I&#8217;ll admit right now that no lot of men or
boys I know could have put this camp up in this shape in such a time. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span> Why,
hullo&#8211;what&#8217;s that? Looks as if you were going to have neighbors,
Nell.&#8221;</p>

<p>His exclamation drew all eyes to the other end of the cove, and the surprise
was general when a string of wagons was seen coming down a road that led to the
beach from the bluff at that point.</p>

<p>&#8220;Looks like a camping party, all right,&#8221; said Trenwith.
&#8220;Wonder who they can be?&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor looked annoyed. She remembered only too well and too vividly the
disturbance that had followed the coming of the yacht, and she wondered if this
new invasion of the peace of Plum Beach might not likewise be the forerunner of
something unpleasant.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve got tents,&#8221; she said, peering curiously at the
wagons. &#8220;See&#8211;they&#8217;re stopping there, and beginning to
unload.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re doing themselves very well, whoever they are,&#8221;
said Trenwith. &#8220;That&#8217;s a pretty luxurious looking camp outfit. And
they&#8217;re having their work done for them by men who know the business,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span>&#8220;Yes, and
they&#8217;re not making a much better job of it than these girls did,&#8221;
said Charlie. &#8220;Great Scott! Look at those cases of canned goods!
They&#8217;ve got enough stuff there to feed a regiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry they&#8217;re coming!&#8221; said Eleanor,
&#8220;whoever they are! I don&#8217;t want to seem nasty, but we were ever so
happy last summer when we were here quite alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;These people won&#8217;t bother you, Nell,&#8221; said Jamieson.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t suppose this could be another trick of Mr.
Holmes&#8217;s, do you, Charlie!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hardly&#8211;so soon,&#8221; he said, frowning.</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t leave us in peace very long after we got here, you
know. We only arrived yesterday&#8211;and see what happened to us last
night!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we might stroll over and have a look,&#8221; suggested Trenwith.
&#8220;I guess there aren&#8217;t any private property rights on this beach.
We&#8217;ll just look them over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;Want to come, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span> Dolly and Bessie? I see
you&#8217;ve finished your share of the work before the others.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the five of them walked over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s going to camp here?&#8221; Trenwith asked one of the
workmen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, sir. We just got orders to set up the tents.
That&#8217;s all we know about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The three girls exchanged glances. That sounded as if it might indeed be Mr.
Holmes who was coming. But before any more questions could be asked, there was a
sudden peal of girlish laughter from above and a wild rush down from the
bluff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dolly Ransom! Isn&#8217;t this a surprise? And didn&#8217;t we tell
you we had a surprise for you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Marcia Bates!&#8221; cried Dolly and Bessie, in one breath, as
the newcomer reached them. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know you were going to leave
Lake Dean so soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we did! And we&#8217;re all here&#8211;Gladys Cooper, and all
the Halsted Camp Girls!&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span><a id='link_4'></a>CHAPTER IV<br /><span class='h2fs'>ONE FRIEND LESS</span></h2>

<p>In a moment the rest of the Halsted girls had reached the beach and were
gathered about Bessie and Dolly. There was a lot of laughter and excitement, but
it was plain that the girls who had once so utterly despised the members of the
Camp Fire were now heartily and enthusiastically glad to see them. And suddenly
Eleanor gave a glad cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Mary Turner!&#8221; she said. &#8220;Whatever are you doing here?
I thought you were going to Europe!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was, until this cousin of mine&#8221;&#8211;she playfully tapped
Marcia on the shoulder&#8211;&#8220;made me change my plans. I&#8217;ll have you
to understand that you&#8217;re not the only girl who can be a Camp Fire
Guardian, Eleanor Mercer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; gasped Eleanor, &#8220;of all things! Do <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span> you mean that you&#8217;ve
organized a new Camp Fire?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We certainly have&#8211;the Halsted Camp Fire, if you please!
We&#8217;re not really all in yet, but we&#8217;ve got permission now from the
National Council, and the girls are to get their rings to-night at our first
ceremonial camp fire. Won&#8217;t you girls come over and help us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say we would!&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;Why, this is fine,
Mary! Tell me how it happened, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all your fault&#8211;you must know that. The girls have
told me all about the horrid way they acted at Lake Dean, but really, you
can&#8217;t blame them so much, can you, Nell? It&#8217;s the way they&#8217;re
brought up&#8211;and, well, you went to the school, too, just as I
did!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you mean,&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;It&#8217;s a fine
school, but&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it exactly&#8211;that <i>but</i>. The school has got into
bad ways, and these girls were in a fair way to be snobs. Well, Marcia and some
of the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span> others got to
thinking things over, and they decided that if the Camp Fire had done so much
for Dolly Ransom and a lot of your girls, it would be a good thing for them,
too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re perfectly right, Mary. Oh, I&#8217;m ever so
glad!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So they came to me, and asked me if I wouldn&#8217;t be their
Guardian. I didn&#8217;t want to at first&#8211;and then I was afraid I
wouldn&#8217;t be any good. But I promised to talk to Mrs. Chester, and get her
to suggest someone who would do, and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t tell me the rest,&#8221; laughed Eleanor. &#8220;I
know just what happened. Mrs. Chester just talked to you in that sweet, gentle
way of hers, and the first thing you knew you felt about as small as a pint of
peanuts, and as if refusing to do the work would be about as mean as stealing
sheep. Now, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary laughed a little ruefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re just right! That&#8217;s exactly how it happened,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;She told me that no one would be able to do as much with these
girls as I could, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span>
and then, when she had me feeling properly ashamed of myself, she turned right
around and began to make me see how much fun I would have out of it myself. So I
talked to Miss Halsted, and made her go to see Mrs. Chester&#8211;and here we
are!&#8221;</p>

<p>Suddenly Eleanor collapsed weakly against one of the empty packing boxes that
littered the place, and began to laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, my dear,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;if you only knew the awful
things we were thinking about you before we knew who you were!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? Do you mean to say that you&#8217;re snobbish, too, and
didn&#8217;t want neighbors you didn&#8217;t know? Like my girls at Lake
Dean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but we thought you might be kidnappers, or murderers, or
fire-bugs, like our last neighbors!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor! Are you crazy&#8211;and if you&#8217;re not, what on earth
are you talking about?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not as crazy as I seem to be, Mary. It&#8217;s only fair to
tell you now that this beach may be a <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_63'></a>63</span> pretty troubled spot while we&#8217;re here. We seem
to attract trouble just as a magnet attracts iron.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you <i>are</i> crazy, Nell. If you&#8217;re not, won&#8217;t
you explain what you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look at our camp over there, Mary. It&#8217;s pretty solid and
complete, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only hope ours looks half as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, this morning at sunrise there were just two tents standing.
Everything else had been burnt. And I was doing my best to get the police or
someone from Bay City to rescue two of my girls who were prisoners on a yacht
out there in the cove!&#8221;</p>

<p>Mary Turner appealed whimsically to Charlie Jamieson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she mean it, Charlie?&#8221; she begged. &#8220;Or is she just
trying to string me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid she means it, and I happen to know it&#8217;s all
true, Mary,&#8221; said Charlie, enjoying her bewilderment. &#8220;But
it&#8217;s a long story. Perhaps you&#8217;d better let it keep until you have
put things to rights.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>&#8220;We&#8217;ll
help in doing that,&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;Dolly, run over and get the
other girls, won&#8217;t you? Then we&#8217;ll all turn in and lend a hand, and
it will all be done in no time at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed you won&#8217;t!&#8221; said Marcia. &#8220;We&#8217;re going
to do everything ourselves, just to show that we can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There isn&#8217;t much to do,&#8221; said Mary Turner, with a laugh.
&#8220;So you needn&#8217;t act as if that were something to be proud of,
Marcia. You see, I thought it was better to take things easily at the start,
Eleanor. They wanted to come here with all the tents and things and set up the
camp by themselves, but I decided it was better to have the harder work done by
men who knew their business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You were quite right, too,&#8221; agreed Eleanor. &#8220;That&#8217;s
the way I arranged things for our own camp the day we came. To-day we did do the
work ourselves, but there was a reason for the girls were so excited and nervous
about the fire <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span> that
I thought it was better to give them a chance to work off their excitement that
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m dying to hear all about the fire and what has happened
here,&#8221; said Mary. &#8220;But I suppose we&#8217;d better get everything
put to rights first.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, though the girls of the new Camp Fire insisted on doing all the actual
work themselves, they were glad enough to take the advice of the Manasquan girls
in innumerable small matters. Comfort, and even safety from illness, in camp
life, depends upon the observance of many seemingly trifling rules.</p>

<p>Gladys Cooper, who, more than any of her companions at Camp Halsted, had
tried to make things unpleasant for the Manasquan girls at Lake Dean, had not
been with the first section of the new Camp Fire to reach the beach. Dolly had
inquired about her rather anxiously, for Gladys had not taken part in the
general reconciliation between the two parties of girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gladys?&#8221; Marcia said. &#8220;Oh, yes, she&#8217;s coming.
She&#8217;s back in the wagon that&#8217;s bringing our <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span> suit cases. We appointed her a sort of
rear guard. It wouldn&#8217;t do to lose those things, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was afraid&#8211;I sort of thought she might not want to come here
if she knew we were here, Marcia. You know&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I <i>do</i> know, Dolly. She behaved worse than any of us, and
she wasn&#8217;t ready to admit it when you girls left Lake Dean. But
she&#8217;s come to her senses since then, I&#8217;m sure. The rest of us made
her do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie King looked a little dubious.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you didn&#8217;t bother her about it, Marcia,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;You know we haven&#8217;t anything against her. We were sorry she
didn&#8217;t like us, and understand that we only wanted to be friends, but we
certainly didn&#8217;t feel angry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If she was bothered, as you call it, Bessie, it served her good and
right,&#8221; said Marcia, crisply. &#8220;We&#8217;ve had about enough of
Gladys and her superior ways. She isn&#8217;t any better or cleverer or prettier
than anyone else, and it&#8217;s time she stopped giving herself
airs.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>&#8220;You
don&#8217;t understand,&#8221; said Bessie, with a smile. &#8220;She&#8217;s one
of you, and if you don&#8217;t like the way she acts, you&#8217;ve got a perfect
right to let her know it, and make her just as uncomfortable as you
like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We did,&#8221; said Marcia. &#8220;I guess she&#8217;s had a lesson
that will teach her it doesn&#8217;t pay to be a snob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but don&#8217;t you think that&#8217;s something a person has to
learn for herself, without anyone to teach her, Marcia? I mean, there&#8217;s
only one reason why she could be nice to us, and that&#8217;s because she likes
us. And you can&#8217;t make her like us by punishing her for not liking us.
You&#8217;ll only make her hate us more than ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll behave herself, anyhow, Bessie. And that&#8217;s more
than she did before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s true enough. But really, it would be better, if she
didn&#8217;t like us, for her to show it frankly than to go around with a grudge
against us she&#8217;s afraid to show. Don&#8217;t you see that she&#8217;ll
blame us for making trouble between you girls <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_68'></a>68</span> and her? She&#8217;ll think that we&#8217;ve set her
own friends against her. Really, Marcia, I think all the trouble would be ended
sooner, in the long run, if you just let her alone until she changed her mind.
She&#8217;ll do it, sooner or later.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess Bessie&#8217;s right, Marcia,&#8221; said Dolly, thoughtfully.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why Gladys acts this way, but I do think that the only
thing that will make her act differently will be for her to feel differently,
and nothing you can do will do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s too late now, anyhow,&#8221; said Marcia. &#8220;I
see what you mean, and I suppose you really are right. But it&#8217;s done.
You&#8217;ll be nice to her, won&#8217;t you? She&#8217;s promised to be
pleasant when she sees you&#8211;to talk to you, and all that. I don&#8217;t
know how well she&#8217;ll manage, but I guess she&#8217;ll do her
best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no reason why we shouldn&#8217;t be nice to her,&#8221;
said Bessie. &#8220;She isn&#8217;t hurting us. I only hope that something will
happen so that we can be good friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She really is a nice girl,&#8221; said Marcia, &#8220;and <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span> I&#8217;m awfully fond of
her when she isn&#8217;t in one of her tantrums. But she is certainly hard to
get along with when everything isn&#8217;t going just to suit her little
whims.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here she comes now,&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to meet
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you certainly did give us a surprise, Gladys,&#8221; cried
Dolly. &#8220;You sinner, why didn&#8217;t you tell us what you were going to
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, hello, Dolly!&#8221; said Gladys, coolly. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
see much of you at Lake Dean, you know. You were too busy with your&#8211;new
friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come off, Gladys!&#8221; said Dolly, irritated despite her
determination to go more than half way in re-establishing friendly relations
with Gladys. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t you be sensible? We&#8217;ve got more to
forgive than you have, and we&#8217;re willing to be friends. Aren&#8217;t you
going to behave decently?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I know just what you mean, Dolly,&#8221; said
Gladys, stiffly. &#8220;As long as the other girls have decided to be friendly
with your&#8211;friends, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_70'></a>70</span> I am not going to make myself unpleasant. But you can
hardly expect me to like people just because you do. I must say that I get along
better with girls of my own class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to be mad at you, Gladys,&#8221; said Dolly, with a peal of
laughter. &#8220;But you&#8217;re too funny! What do you mean by girls of your
own class? Girls whose parents have as much money as yours? Mine haven&#8217;t.
So I suppose I&#8217;m not in your class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense, Dolly!&#8221; said Gladys, angrily. &#8220;You know
perfectly well I don&#8217;t mean anything of the sort. I&#8211;I can&#8217;t
explain just what I mean by my own class&#8211;but you know it just as well as I
do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I know it better, Gladys,&#8221; said Dolly, gravely.
&#8220;Now don&#8217;t get angry, because I&#8217;m not saying this to be mean.
If you had to go about with girls of your own class you couldn&#8217;t stand
them for a week! Because they&#8217;d be snobbish and mean. They&#8217;d be
thinking all the time about how much nicer their clothes were than yours, or the
other way around. They wouldn&#8217;t have a good <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span> word for anyone&#8211;they&#8217;d just
be trying to think about the mean things they could say!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Dolly! What do you mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean that that&#8217;s your class&#8211;the sort you are. Our girls,
in the Manasquan Camp Fire, and most of the Halsted girls, are in a class a
whole lot better than yours, Gladys. They spend their time trying to be nice,
and to make other people happy. There isn&#8217;t any reason why you
shouldn&#8217;t improve, and get into their class, but you&#8217;re not in it
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard of such a thing, Dolly! Do you mean to tell me that you
and I aren&#8217;t in a better class socially than these girls you&#8217;re
camping with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not talking about society&#8211;and you haven&#8217;t any
business to be. You don&#8217;t know anything about it. But if people are
divided into real classes, the two big classes are nice people and people who
aren&#8217;t nice. And each of those classes is divided up again into a lot of
other classes. I hope I&#8217;m in as good a class as Bessie King and <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span> Margery Burton, but
I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;m not. And I know you&#8217;re not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no use talking to you, Dolly,&#8221; said Gladys,
furiously. &#8220;I thought you&#8217;d had time to get over all that nonsense,
but I see you&#8217;re worse than ever. I&#8217;m perfectly willing to be
friends with you, and I&#8217;ve forgiven you for throwing those mice at us at
Lake Dean, but I certainly don&#8217;t see why I should be friendly with all
those common girls in your camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re not common&#8211;and don&#8217;t you dare to say they
are! And you certainly can&#8217;t be my friend if you&#8217;re going to talk
about them that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; snapped Gladys. &#8220;I guess I can get along
without your friendship if you can get along without mine!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to,&#8221; she said, disgustedly, to Bessie and
Marcia, &#8220;but I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve simply made her madder than ever.
And there&#8217;s no telling what she&#8217;ll do now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I guess there&#8217;s nothing to worry about,&#8221; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span> said Marcia, cheerfully
enough. &#8220;We can keep her in order all right, and if she doesn&#8217;t
behave herself decently I guess you&#8217;ll find that Miss Turner will send her
home in a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope not,&#8221; said Bessie. &#8220;That wouldn&#8217;t really
do any good, would it? We want to be friends with her&#8211;not to have any more
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I&#8217;d kept out of it,&#8221; said Dolly, dolefully.
&#8220;I think I can keep my temper, and then I go off and make things worse
than ever! I ought to know enough not to interfere. I&#8217;m like the elephant
that killed a little mother bird by accident, and he was so sorry that he sat on
its nest to hatch the eggs!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe it&#8217;s a good thing,&#8221; said Marcia, laughing at the
picture of the elephant. &#8220;After all, isn&#8217;t it a good deal as Bessie
said? If there&#8217;s bad feeling, it&#8217;s better to have it open and
aboveboard. We all know where we are now, anyhow. And I certainly hope that
something will turn up to change her mind.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span><a id='link_5'></a>CHAPTER V<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE COUNCIL FIRE</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;I hope it will, Bessie,&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;But you know what a
nasty temper I&#8217;ve got. If she keeps on talking the way she has, I
don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ll say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you might as well say what you like, Dolly. I believe she wants
a good quarrel with someone&#8211;and it might as well be you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean you think she likes me to get angry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course she does! There wouldn&#8217;t be any fun in it for her if
you didn&#8217;t. Can&#8217;t you see that?&#8221;</p>

<p>Dolly looked very thoughtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I won&#8217;t give her the satisfaction of getting angry!&#8221;
she declared, finally. &#8220;Of course you&#8217;re right, Bessie. If we
didn&#8217;t pay any attention at all to her it wouldn&#8217;t do her a bit of
good to get angry, would it?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>&#8220;I wondered
how long it would take you to see that, Dolly.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were walking back to their own tents as they spoke. Once arrived there,
neither said anything about the spirit Gladys had shown. They both felt that it
would be as well to let the other girls think that Gladys shared the friendly
feelings of the other Halsted girls. And since Bessie and Dolly happened to be
the only ones who knew that Gladys had been the prime mover in the trouble that
had been made at Lake Dean, it was easy enough to conceal the true facts.</p>

<p>&#8220;She can&#8217;t do anything by herself,&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;Up
at Lake Dean nothing would have happened unless the rest of those girls had
taken her part against us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to try to forget about her altogether, Dolly,&#8221;
said Bessie. &#8220;I&#8217;m not a bit angry at her, but if she won&#8217;t be
friends, she won&#8217;t and that&#8217;s all there is to it. And I don&#8217;t
see why I should worry about her when there are so many <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span> nice girls who <i>do</i> want to be
friendly. Why, what are you laughing at?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just thinking of how mad Gladys would be if she really
understood! She&#8217;s made herself think that she is doing a great favor to
people when she makes friends of them&#8211;and, if she only knew it, she would
have a hard time having us for friends now.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Charlie Jamieson and Billy Trenwith accepted Eleanor&#8217;s pressing
invitation to stay for the evening meal, but Trenwith seemed to feel that they
were wasting time that might be better spent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not wasting it exactly,&#8221; he said, however, when Eleanor
laughingly accused him of feeling so. &#8220;But I do sort of think that Charlie
and I ought to keep after this man Holmes. He seems to be a tough customer, and
I&#8217;ll bet he&#8217;s busy, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The only point, Billy,&#8221; said Charlie, &#8220;is that, no matter
how busy we were, there&#8217;s mighty little we could do. We don&#8217;t know
enough, you see. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span> But
maybe when I get up to the city, I&#8217;ll find out more. I&#8217;ll go over
the facts with you in Bay City to-night, and then I&#8217;ll go up to town and
see what I can do with Jake Hoover and Zara&#8217;s father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s do something, for Heaven&#8217;s sake!&#8221; said
Trenwith. &#8220;I hate to think that all you girls out here are in danger as a
result of this man&#8217;s villainy. If he does anything rotten, I can see that
he&#8217;s punished but that might not do you much good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you what would do some good, and that&#8217;s to let Holmes
know that you will punish him, if he exposes himself to punishment,&#8221; said
Charlie Jamieson. &#8220;That&#8217;s the chief reason he&#8217;s so bold. He
thinks he&#8217;s above the law&#8211;that he can do anything, and escape the
consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, of course,&#8221; said Trenwith, &#8220;it may enlighten him a
bit when he finds that those rascals we caught to-day will have to stand trial,
just as if they were friendless criminals. If what you say about him is so,
he&#8217;ll be after me to-morrow, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_79'></a>79</span> trying to call me off. And I guess he&#8217;ll find
that he&#8217;s up against the law for once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you get that telephone fixed up, Nell?&#8221; asked Charlie.
&#8220;You&#8217;re a whole lot safer with a telephone right here on the beach.
Being half a mile from the nearest place where you can ever call for help is bad
business.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor pointed to a row of poles, on which a wire was strung, leading into
the main living tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;There it is,&#8221; she said, gaily. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you
got them to do it so fast, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Billy&#8217;s a sort of political boss round here, as well as district
attorney,&#8221; laughed Jamieson. &#8220;When he says a thing&#8217;s to be
done, and done in a hurry, he usually has his way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor looked curiously at Trenwith, and Charlie, catching the glance,
winked broadly at Dolly Ransom. It was perfectly plain that the young District
Attorney interested Eleanor a good deal. His quiet efficiency appealed to her.
She liked men who did things, and Trenwith was essentially <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span> of that type. He didn&#8217;t talk much
about his plans; he let results speak for him. And, at the same time, when there
was a question of something to be done, what he did say showed a quiet
confidence, which, while not a bit boastful, proved that he was as sure of
himself as are most competent men.</p>

<p>Also, his admiration for Eleanor was plain and undisguised. Charlie Jamieson,
who was almost like a brother in his relations with Eleanor, was hugely amused
by this. Somehow cousins who are so intimate with a girl that they take a
brother&#8217;s place, never do seem able to understand that she may have the
same attraction for other men that the sisters and the cousins of the other men
have for them. The idea that their friends may fall in love with the girls they
regard in such a perfectly matter-of-fact way strikes them, when it reaches them
at all, as a huge joke.</p>

<p>All the girls were sorry to see the two men who had helped them so much go
away after dinner, but of course their departure was necessary. Just <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span> now, after the exciting
events of the previous night, there seemed a reasonable chance of a little
peace, but the price of freedom from the annoyance caused by Holmes was constant
vigilance, and there was work for both the men to do. Moreover, the sight of the
cheerful fire from the other camp, and the thought of the great camp fire they
were presently to enjoy in common consoled them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Halsted girls are going to build the fire,&#8221; said Eleanor.
&#8220;It&#8217;s their first ceremonial camp fire, so I told Miss Turner they
were welcome to do it. They&#8217;re all Wood-Gatherers, you see. So we&#8217;ll
have to light the fire for them, anyhow. See, they&#8217;re at work already,
bringing in the wood. Margery, suppose you go over and make sure that
they&#8217;re building the fire properly, with plenty of room for a good draught
underneath.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who&#8217;s going to take them in, and give them their rings, Miss
Eleanor?&#8221; asked Dolly. &#8220;You, or Miss Turner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Turner wants me to do it, Dolly, because I&#8217;m older in
the Camp Fire than she is. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_82'></a>82</span> She&#8217;s given me the rings. I think it&#8217;s
quite exciting, really, taking so many new girls in all at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on,&#8221; cried Margery Burton, then. &#8220;They&#8217;re all
ready and they want us to form the procession now, and go over there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are to light the fire, Margery. Are you all ready?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, Miss Eleanor. Shall I go ahead, and start the
flame?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, do!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then while Margery disappeared, Eleanor, at the head of the girls, started
moving in the stately Indian measure toward the dark pile of wood that
represented the fire that was so soon to blaze up. As they walked they sang in
low tones, so that the melody rose and mingled with the waves and the sighing of
the wind.</p>

<p>Just as the first spark answered Margery&#8217;s efforts with her fire-making
sticks, they reached the fire, and sat down in a great circle, with a good deal
of space between each pair of girls. Eleanor <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_83'></a>83</span> took her place in the centre, facing Margery, who now
stood up, lifting a torch that she had lighted above her head. As she touched
the tinder beneath the fire Eleanor raised her hand, and, as the flames began to
crackle, she lowered it, and at once the girls began the song of Wo-he-lo:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>Wo-he-lo means love.<br /> Wo-he-lo, wo-he-lo, wo-he-lo.<br /> We love
love, for love is the heart of life.<br /> It is light and joy and
sweetness,<br /> Comradeship and all dear kinship.<br /> Love is the joy of
service so deep<br /> That self is forgotten.<br /> Wo-he-lo means love.</p>
</div><!-- poetry -->

<p>Outside the circle now other and unseen voices joined them in the chorus:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>Wo-he-lo for aye,<br /> Wo-he-lo for aye,<br /> Wo-he-lo, wo-he-lo,
wo-he-lo for aye!</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>Then for a moment utter silence, so that the murmur of the waves seemed
amazingly loud. Then, their voices hushed, half the Manasquan girls chanted:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>Wo-he-lo for work!</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>And the others, their voices rising gradually, answered with:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>Wo-he-lo for
health!</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>And without a break in the rhythm, all the girls joined in the final</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>Wo-he-lo, wo-he-lo, wo-he-lo for love!</p> </div><!-- poetry -->

<p>Then Margery, her torch still raised above her head, while she swung it
slowly in time to the music of her song, sang alone:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>O Fire!<br /> Long years ago when our fathers fought with great animals you
were their great protection.@<br /> When they fought the cold of the cruel
winter you saved them.<br /> When they needed food you changed the flesh of
beasts into savory meat for them.<br /> During all the ages your mysterious
flame has been a symbol to them for Spirit,<br /> So, to-night, we light our
fire in grateful remembrance of the Great Spirit who gave you to us.</p>
</div><!-- poetry -->

<p>Then Margery took her place in the circle, and Eleanor called the roll,
giving each girl the name she had chosen as her fire name.</p>

<p>Then Mary Turner, in her new ceremonial robe, fringed with beads, slipped
into the circle of the firelight, bright and vivid now.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Wanaka,&#8221; she said, calling Eleanor by her <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span> ceremonial name, &#8220;I
bring to-night these newcomers to the Camp Fire, to tell you their Desire, and to
receive from you their rings.&#8221;</p>

<p>One by one the girls of the Halsted Camp Fire stepped forward, and each
repeated her Desire to be a Wood-Gatherer, and was received by Eleanor, who
explained to each some new point of the Law of the Fire, so that all might
learn. And to each, separately, as she slipped the silver ring of the Camp Fire
on her finger, she repeated the beautiful exhortation:</p>

<div class='poetry'>
<p>Firmly held by the sinews which bind them,<br /> As fagots are brought from
the forest<br /> So cleave to these others, your sisters,<br /> Whenever,
wherever you find them.<br /> &#160;<br /> Be strong as the fagots are
sturdy;<br /> Be pure in your deepest desire;<br /> Be true to the truth
that is in you;<br /> And&#8211;follow the law of the Fire!</p> </div><!--
poetry -->

<p>One by one as they received their rings, the newcomers slipped into seats
about the fire, each one finding a place between two of the Manasquan girls.
Marcia Bates, flushed with pleasure, took a seat between Bessie and Dolly.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span>&#8220;Oh, how
beautiful it all is!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how any of us
could ever have laughed at the Camp Fire! But, of course, we didn&#8217;t know,
about all this, or we never would have laughed as we did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I love the part about &#8216;So cleave to these others, your
sisters,&#8217;&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;It&#8217;s so fine to feel that
wherever you go, you&#8217;ll find friends wherever there&#8217;s a Camp
Fire&#8211;that you can show your ring, and be sure that there&#8217;ll be
someone who knows the same thing you know, and believes in the same sort of
things!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s lovely, Dolly. Of course, we&#8217;ve all read about
this, but you have to do it to know how beautiful it is. I&#8217;m so glad you
girls were here for this first Council Fire of ours. You know how everything
should be done, and that seems to make it so much better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would have pleased you just as much, and been just as lovely if
you&#8217;d done it all by yourselves, Marcia. It&#8217;s the words, and the
ceremony that are so beautiful&#8211;not the way we do it. Every <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span> Camp Fire has its own way
of doing things. For instance, some Camp Fires sing the Ode to Fire all
together, but we have Margery do it alone because she has such a lovely
voice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it was splendid. I never had any idea she could sing so
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her voice is lovely, but it sounds particularly soft and true out in
the open air this way, and without a piano to accompany her. Mine
doesn&#8217;t&#8211;I&#8217;m all right to sing in a crowd, but when I try to
sing by myself, it&#8217;s just a sort of screech. There isn&#8217;t any beauty
to my tones at all, and I know it and don&#8217;t try to sing alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t they all in now?&#8221; asked Bessie.</p>

<p>There had been a break in the steady appearance of new candidates before
Eleanor. But, even as she spoke, another figure glided into the light.</p>

<p>&#8220;No. There&#8217;s Gladys Cooper,&#8221; said Marcia, with a little
start.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder if she sees what there is to the Camp Fire now,&#8221; said
Dolly, speculatively.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your desire?&#8221; asked Eleanor.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>&#8220;I desire to
become a Camp Fire Girl and to obey the law of the Camp Fire,&#8221; said
Gladys, in a mechanical, sing-song voice, entirely different from the serious
tones of those who had preceded her.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s laughing to herself,&#8221; said Marcia, indignantly.
&#8220;Just listen! She&#8217;s repeating the Desire as if it were a bit of
doggerel.&#8221;</p>

<p>They heard her saying:</p>

<p>&#8220;Seek beauty, Give service, Pursue knowledge, Hold on to health,
Glorify work, Be happy. This law of the Camp Fire I will strive to
follow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Give service,&#8221; repeated Eleanor slowly. &#8220;You have heard
what I said to the other girls, Gladys. I want you to understand this point of
the law. It is the most important of all, perhaps. It means that you must be
friendly to your sisters of the Camp Fire; that you must love them, and put them
above yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must do all that for my chums&#8211;the girls in our Camp Fire, you
mean, I suppose?&#8221; said Gladys. &#8220;I don&#8217;t care anything about
these other girls. And, Miss Mercer, all that you&#8217;re going <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span> to say in a
minute&#8211;&#8216;So cleave to these others, your sisters&#8217;&#8211;that
doesn&#8217;t mean the girls in any old Camp Fire, does it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Startled, Eleanor was silent for a moment. Mary Turner looked at Gladys
indignantly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It means every girl in every Camp Fire,&#8221; said Eleanor, finally.
&#8220;And more than that, you must serve others, in or out of the Camp
Fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s nonsense!&#8221; said Gladys. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t
do that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are not fit to receive your ring,&#8221; said Eleanor.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span><a id='link_6'></a>CHAPTER VI<br /><span class='h2fs'>AN UNHAPPY ENDING</span></h2>

<p>There was a gasp of astonishment and dismay from the girls. Somehow all
seemed to feel as if Eleanor&#8217;s reproach were directed at them instead of
at the pale and angry Gladys, who stood, scarcely able to believe her ears,
looking at the Guardian. There had been no anger in Eleanor&#8217;s
voice&#8211;only sorrow and distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what do you mean, Miss Mercer?&#8221; Gladys gasped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly what I say, Gladys,&#8221; said Eleanor, in the same level
voice. &#8220;You are not fit to be one of us unless you mean sincerely and
earnestly to keep the Law of the Fire. We are a sisterhood; no girl who is not
only willing, but eager, to become our sister, may join us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly the meaning of her rejection seemed to sink into the mind of
Gladys.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>&#8220;Do you mean
that you&#8217;re not going to let me join?&#8221; she asked in a shrill,
high-pitched voice that showed she was on the verge of giving way to an outbreak
of hysterical anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;For your own sake it is better that you should not join now, Gladys.
Listen to me. I do not blame you greatly for this. I would rather have you act
this way than be a hypocrite, pretending to believe in our law when you do
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hate you! I hate the Camp Fire! I wouldn&#8217;t join for
anything in the world, after this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be time to settle that when we are ready to let you join,
Gladys,&#8221; said Eleanor, a little sternness creeping into her voice, as if
she were growing angry for the first time. &#8220;To join the Camp Fire is a
privilege. Remember this&#8211;no girl does the Camp Fire a favor by joining it.
The Camp Fire does not need any one girl, no matter how clever, or how pretty,
or how able she may be, as much as that girl needs the Camp <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span> Fire. The Camp Fire, as a whole, is a
much greater, finer thing than any single member.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sobs of anger were choking Gladys when she tried to answer. She could not
form intelligible words.</p>

<p>Eleanor glanced at Mary Turner, and the Guardian of the new Camp Fire, on the
hint, put her arm about Gladys.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;d better go back to the camp now, dear,&#8221; she
said, very gently. &#8220;You and I will have a talk presently, when you feel
better, and perhaps you will see that you are wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>All the life and spirit seemed to have left the girls as Gladys, her head
bowed, the sound of her sobs still plainly to be heard, left the circle of the
firelight and made her lonely way over the beach toward the tents of her own
camp. For a few moments silence reigned. Then Eleanor spoke, coolly and
steadily, although Mary Turner, who was close to her, knew what an effort her
seeming calm represented.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have had a hard thing to do to-night,&#8221; <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span> she said. &#8220;I know that none of you
will add to what Gladys has made herself suffer. She is in the wrong, but I
think that very few of us will have any difficulty in remembering many times
when we have been wrong, and have been sure that we were right. Gladys thinks
now that we are all against her&#8211;that we wanted to humiliate her. We must
make her understand that she is wrong. Remember, Wo-he-lo means love.&#8221;</p>

<p>She paused for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wo-he-lo means love,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;And not love for
those whom we cannot help loving. The love that is worth while is that we give
to those who repel us, who do not want our love. It is easy to love those who
love us. But in time we can make Gladys love us by showing that we want to love
her and do what we can to make her happy. And now, since I think none of us feel
like staying here, we will sing our good-night song and disperse.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the soft voices rose like a benediction, mingling <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span> in the lovely strains of that most
beautiful of all the Camp Fire songs.</p>

<p>Silently, and without the usual glad talk that followed the ending of a
Council Fire, the circle broke up, and the girls, in twos and threes, spread
over the beach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Walk over with me, won&#8217;t you?&#8221; Marcia Bates begged Dolly
and Bessie. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so ashamed! I never thought Gladys would act
like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t your fault, Marcia,&#8221; said Dolly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly about it. And, do you know, I&#8217;m not angry a
bit! Just at first I thought I was going to be furious. But&#8211;well, somehow
I can&#8217;t help admiring Gladys! I like her better than I ever did before, I
really do believe!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I do!&#8221; said Bessie, her eyes glowing. &#8220;Wasn&#8217;t
she splendid? Of course, she&#8217;s all wrong, but she had to be plucky to
stand up there like that, when she knew everyone was against her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But she had no right to insult all you girls, Bessie.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>&#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe she meant to insult us a bit,&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think she thought much about us. It&#8217;s just that she has always
been brought up to feel a certain way about things, and she couldn&#8217;t
change all at once. A whole lot of girls, while they believed just what she did,
and hated the whole idea just as much, would never have dared to say so, when
they knew no one agreed with them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s just as Miss Eleanor said,&#8221; said Bessie,
&#8220;She&#8217;s not a hypocrite, no matter what her other faults are.
She&#8217;s not afraid to say just what she thinks&#8211;and that&#8217;s pretty
fine, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish she could hear you,&#8221; said Marcia, indignantly. &#8220;Oh,
it&#8217;s splendid of you, but I can&#8217;t feel that way, and there&#8217;s
no use pretending. I suppose the real reason I&#8217;m so angry is that
I&#8217;m really very fond of Gladys, and I hate to see her acting this way.
She&#8217;s making a perfect fool of herself, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But just think of how splendid it will be when <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span> she sees she is wrong, Marcia,&#8221;
said Bessie. &#8220;Because you want to remember if she&#8217;s plucky enough to
hold out against all her friends this way she will be plucky enough to own up
when she sees the truth, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and she&#8217;ll be a convert worth making, too,&#8221; said
Dolly. &#8220;There&#8217;s just one thing I&#8217;m thinking of, Marcia. Will
she stay here? Don&#8217;t you suppose she&#8217;ll go home right away? I know I
would. I wouldn&#8217;t want to stay around this beach after what happened at
the Council Fire to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>They never heard Marcia&#8217;s answer to that question, for in the darkness,
Gladys herself, shaking with anger, rose and confronted them.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet I&#8217;m going to stay!&#8221; she declared, furiously.
&#8220;And I&#8217;ll get even with you, Dolly Ransom, and your nasty old Miss
Mercer, and the whole crew of you! Maybe you&#8217;ve been able to set all my
friends against me&#8211;I&#8217;m glad of it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one is set against you, Gladys,&#8221; said Marcia, gently.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>&#8220;Maybe you
don&#8217;t call it that, Marcia Bates, but I&#8217;ve got my own opinion of a
lot of girls who call themselves my friends and side against me the way
you&#8217;ve done!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Gladys, I haven&#8217;t done a thing&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just it, you sneak! Why, do you suppose I&#8217;d have
let them treat you as I was treated to-night? If it had happened to you and
I&#8217;d joined before, I&#8217;d have got up and thrown their nasty old ring
back at them! I don&#8217;t want their old ring! I&#8217;ve got much prettier
ones of my own&#8211;gold, and set with sapphires and diamonds!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very glad you&#8217;re going to stay, Gladys!&#8221; said
Dolly. &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry I&#8217;ve been cross when I spoke to you lately
two or three times, and I hope you&#8217;ll forgive me. And I think you&#8217;ll
see soon that we&#8217;re not at all what you think we are in the Camp
Fire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you needn&#8217;t talk that way to me, Dolly Ransom! You can
pretend all you like to be a saint, but I&#8217;ve known you too long to swallow
all that! You&#8217;ve done just as many mean things as <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span> anyone else! And now you stand around and
act as if you were ashamed to know me. Just you wait! I&#8217;ll get even with
you, and all the rest of your new friends, if it&#8217;s the last thing I ever
do!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie&#8217;s hand reached out for Dolly&#8217;s. She knew her chum well
enough to understand that if Dolly controlled her temper now it would only be by
the exercise of the grimmest determination. Sure enough, Dolly&#8217;s hand was
trembling, and Bessie could almost feel the hot anger that was swelling up in
her. But Dolly mastered herself nobly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t make me angry now, Gladys,&#8221; said Dolly, finally.
&#8220;You&#8217;re perfectly right; I&#8217;ve done things that are meaner than
anything you did at Lake Dean. And I&#8217;m just as sorry for them now as you
will be when you understand better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you needn&#8217;t preach to me!&#8221; said Gladys, fiercely.
&#8220;And you can give up expecting me to run away. I&#8217;m not a coward,
whatever else I may be! And I&#8217;d never be able to hold up my head if I
thought a lot of common girls had frightened <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_100'></a>100</span> me into running away from this place. I&#8217;m
going to stay here, and I&#8217;m going to have a good time, and you&#8217;d
better look out for yourselves&#8211;that&#8217;s all I can say! Maybe I know
more about you than you think.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then she turned on her heel and left them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Whew!&#8221; said Marcia. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how you kept your
temper, Dolly. If she&#8217;d said half as much to me as she did to you, I never
could have stood it, I can tell you! Whatever did she mean by what she said just
then about knowing more than we thought?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Dolly, rather anxiously. &#8220;But
look here, Marcia, I might as well tell you now. There&#8217;s likely to be a
good deal of excitement here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Bessie, rather bitterly. &#8220;And it&#8217;s all my
fault&#8211;mine and Zara&#8217;s, that is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what you can mean,&#8221; said Marcia,
mystified.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s quite a long story, but I really think <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span> you&#8217;d better know
all about it, Marcia,&#8221; said Dolly.</p>

<p>And so, with occasional help from Bessie herself, when Dolly forgot
something, or when Bessie&#8217;s ideas disagreed with hers, Dolly poured the
story of the adventures of Bessie and Zara since their flight from Hedgeville
into Marcia&#8217;s ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I never heard of such a thing!&#8221; Marcia exclaimed, when the
story was told. &#8220;So that fire last night wasn&#8217;t an accident at
all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re quite sure it wasn&#8217;t, Marcia. And don&#8217;t you
think it looks as if we were right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly does, and I think it&#8217;s dreadful, Dolly&#8211;just
dreadful. Oh, Bessie, I am so sorry for you!&#8221;</p>

<p>She threw her arms about Bessie impulsively and kissed her, while Dolly,
delighted, looked on.</p>

<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it make you love her more than ever?&#8221; she said.
&#8220;And Bessie is so foolish about it sometimes. She seems to think that
girls won&#8217;t want to have anything to do with her, because <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span> she hasn&#8217;t had a
home and parents like the rest of us&#8211;or like most of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That <i>is</i> awfully silly, Bessie,&#8221; said Marcia. &#8220;As if
it was your fault! People are going to like you for what you are, and for the
way you behave&#8211;not on account of things that you really haven&#8217;t a
thing to do with. Sensible people, I mean. Of course, if they&#8217;re like
Gladys&#8211;but then most people aren&#8217;t, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course they&#8217;re not!&#8221; said Dolly, stoutly. &#8220;And,
besides, I&#8217;m just sure that Bessie is going to find out about her father
and mother some day. I don&#8217;t believe Mr. Holmes would be taking all the
trouble he has about her unless there were something very surprising about her
history that we don&#8217;t know anything about. Do you, Marcia?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not! He&#8217;s got something up his sleeve. Probably she is
heiress to a fortune, or something like that, and he wants to get hold of it.
He&#8217;s a very rich man, isn&#8217;t he, Dolly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. You know he&#8217;s the owner of a great big department store at
home. And Bessie says <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_103'></a>103</span> that it can&#8217;t be any question of money that
makes him so anxious to get hold of her and of Zara, because he has so much
already.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;H&#8217;m! I guess people who have money like to make more, Dolly.
I&#8217;ve heard my father talk about that. He says they&#8217;re never content,
and that&#8217;s one reason why so many men work themselves to death, simply
because they haven&#8217;t got sense enough to stop and rest when they have
enough money to live comfortably for the rest of their lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s another thing I&#8217;ve told her. And she says that
can&#8217;t be the reason, but just the same she never suggests a better one to
take its place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look here,&#8221; said Marcia, thoughtfully. &#8220;If Mr. Holmes is
spending so much money, doesn&#8217;t it cost a whole lot to stop him from doing
what he&#8217;s trying to do, whatever that is? I&#8217;m just thinking&#8211;my
father has ever so much, you know, and I know if I told him, he&#8217;d be glad
to spend whatever was needed&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie finished unhappily.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>&#8220;Oh,
that&#8217;s one thing that is worrying me terribly!&#8221; she cried, &#8220;I
just know that Miss Eleanor and Mr. Jamieson must have spent a terrible lot on
my affairs already, and I don&#8217;t see how I&#8217;m ever going to pay them
back! And if I ever mention it, Miss Eleanor gets almost angry, and says I
mustn&#8217;t talk about it at all, even think of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, of course you mustn&#8217;t. It would be awful to think that
those horrid people were able to get hold of you and make you unhappy just
because they had money and you didn&#8217;t, Bessie.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Dolly echoed her exclamation. Naturally enough, Marcia, whose parents
were among the richest people in the state, thought little of money, and Dolly,
who had always had plenty, even though her family was by no means as rich as
Marcia&#8217;s, felt the same way about the matter. Neither of them valued money
particularly; but Bessie, because she had lived ever since she could remember in
a family where the pinch of actual <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_105'></a>105</span> poverty was always felt, had a much truer
appreciation of the value of money.</p>

<p>She did not want to possess money, but she had a good deal of native pride,
and it worried her constantly to think that her good friends were spending money
that she could see no prospect, however remote, of repaying.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish there was some way to keep me from having to take all the money
they spend on me,&#8221; she said, wistfully. &#8220;As soon as we get back to
the city, I&#8217;m going to find some work to do, so that I can support
myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>She half expected Marcia to assail that idea, for it seemed to her that, nice
as she was, she belonged, like Gladys Cooper, to the class that looked down on
work and workers. But to her surprise, Marcia gave a cry of admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s splendid for you to feel that way, Bessie!&#8221; she said.
&#8220;But, just the same, I believe you&#8217;ll have to wait until things are
more settled. It would be so much easier for Mr. Holmes to get hold of you if
you were working, you know.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_106'></a>106</span>&#8220;She&#8217;s going to come and stay with me
just as long as she wants to,&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;And, anyhow, I really
believe things are going to be settled for her. Perhaps I&#8217;ve heard
something, too!&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span><a id='link_7'></a>CHAPTER VII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE CHALLENGE</span></h2>

<p>When Bessie and Dolly returned to their own camp they found Eleanor Mercer
waiting for them, and as soon as she was alone with them, she did something
that, for her, was very rare. She asked them about their talk with Marcia
Bates.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that as a rule I don&#8217;t interfere,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Unless there is something that makes it positively necessary for me to
intrude myself, I leave you to yourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, we would have told you all about it, anyhow, Miss Eleanor,&#8221;
said Dolly, surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but even so, I want you to know that I&#8217;m sorry to feel that
I should ask you to tell me. As a rule, I would rather let you girls work all
these things out by yourselves, even if I see very plainly that you are making
mistakes. I think you can sometimes learn more by doing a thing wrong, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span> provided that you are
following your own ideas, than by doing it right when you are simply doing what
someone else tells you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see what you mean, Miss Eleanor,&#8221; said Bessie. &#8220;But this
time we really haven&#8217;t done anything, We saw Gladys, too,
and&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>She went on to tell of their talk with Marcia and of the unpleasant episode
created by Gladys when she had overheard them talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you&#8217;ve done very well indeed,&#8221; said Eleanor, with
a sigh of relief, when she had heard the story. &#8220;I was so afraid that you
would lose your temper, Dolly. Not that I could really have blamed you if you
had, but, oh, it&#8217;s so much better that you didn&#8217;t. So Gladys has
decided to stay, has she!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;But Marcia seemed to think Miss Turner
might make her go home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;She was thinking of it,
but I have had a talk with her, and we both decided that that wouldn&#8217;t do
much good. It might save us some trouble, but it wouldn&#8217;t do <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span> Gladys any good, and,
after all, she&#8217;s the one we&#8217;ve got to consider.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dolly didn&#8217;t say anything, but it was plain from her look that she did
not understand.</p>

<p>&#8220;What I mean is,&#8221; Eleanor went on, &#8220;that there&#8217;s a
chance here for us to make a real convert&#8211;one who will count. It&#8217;s
easy enough to make girls understand our Camp Fire idea when they want to like
it, and feel sure that they&#8217;re going to. The hard cases are the girls like
Gladys, who have a prejudice against the Camp Fire without really knowing
anything at all about it. And if the Camp Fire idea is the fine, strong,
splendid thing we all believe, why, this is a good time to prove it. If it is,
Gladys won&#8217;t be able to hold out against it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve thought from the first, Miss
Eleanor,&#8221; said Bessie. &#8220;And I&#8217;m sure she will like us better
presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if she is willing to stay, she is to stay,&#8221; said Eleanor.
&#8220;And she is to be allowed to do everything the other girls do, except, of
course, <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span> she
can&#8217;t actually take part in a Council Fire until she&#8217;s a member. We
don&#8217;t want her to feel that she is being punished, and Miss Turner is
going to try to make her girls treat her just as if nothing had happened.
That&#8217;s what I want our Manasquan girls to do, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They will, then, if I&#8217;ve got anything to say,&#8221; declared
Dolly, vehemently. &#8220;And I guess I&#8217;ve got more reason to be down on
her than any of the others except Bessie. So if I&#8217;m willing to be nice to
her, I certainly don&#8217;t see why the others should hesitate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember this, Dolly. You&#8217;re willing to be nice to her now, but
she may make it pretty hard. You&#8217;re going to have a stiff test of your
self-control and your temper for the next few days. When people are in the wrong
and know it, but aren&#8217;t ready to admit it and be sorry, they usually go
out of their way to be nasty to those they have injured&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t care what she says or does now,&#8221; said Dolly.
&#8220;If I could talk to her to-night without <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_111'></a>111</span> getting angry, I think I&#8217;m safe. I never came
so near to losing my temper without really doing it in my whole life
before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s fine, Dolly. Keep it up. Remember this is pretty
hard for poor Miss Turner. Here she is, just starting in as a Camp Fire
Guardian, and at the very beginning she has this trouble! But if she does make
Gladys come around, it will be a great victory for her, and I want you and all
of our girls to do everything you can to help.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then with a hearty good-night she turned away, and it was plain that she was
greatly relieved by what Bessie and Dolly had told her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re going to do, Bessie,&#8221;
said Dolly, &#8220;but I&#8217;m going to turn in and sleep! I&#8217;m just
beginning to realize how tired I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired, too. We&#8217;ve really had enough to make us pretty
tired, haven&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>

<p>And this time they were able to sleep through the whole night without
interruption. The peace <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_112'></a>112</span> and calm of Plum Beach were disturbed by nothing
more noisy than gentle waves, and the whole camp awoke in the morning vastly
refreshed.</p>

<p>The sun shone down gloriously, and the cloudless sky proclaimed that it was
to be a day fit for any form of sport. A gentle breeze blew in from the sea,
dying away to nothing sometimes, and the water inside the sand bar was so smooth
and inviting that half a dozen of the girls, with Dolly at their head, scampered
in for a plunge before breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re swimming over at the other camp, too,&#8221; cried
Dolly. &#8220;See? Oh, I bet we&#8217;ll have some good times with them. We
ought to be able to have all sorts of fun in the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t there any boats here beside that old flat bottom
skiff?&#8221; asked Bessie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t there? Just wait till you see! If we hadn&#8217;t had all
that excitement yesterday Captain Salters would have brought the <i>Eleanor</i>
over. He will to-day, too, and then you&#8217;ll see.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>&#8220;What will
I see, Dolly? Remember I haven&#8217;t been here before, like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she&#8217;s the dandiest little boat, Bessie&#8211;a little sloop,
and as fast as a steamboat, if she&#8217;s handled right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;ll never hear the end of her,&#8221; said Margery Burton,
with a comical gesture of despair. &#8220;You&#8217;ve touched the button,
Bessie, and Dolly will keep on telling us about the <i>Eleanor</i>, and how fast
she is, until someone sits on her!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re jealous, Margery,&#8221; laughed Dolly, in high good
humor. &#8220;Margery&#8217;s pretty clever, Bessie, and when it comes to
cooking&#8211;my!&#8221; She smacked her lips loudly, as if to express her sense
of how well Margery could cook. &#8220;But she can&#8217;t sail a
boat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Captain Salters now&#8211;and he&#8217;s towing the
<i>Eleanor</i>, all right, Dolly,&#8221; cried one of the other girls.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad!&#8221; cried Dolly. &#8220;Bessie, you&#8217;ve
never been in a sail boat, have you? I&#8217;ll have to show you how everything
is done, and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span> then
well have some bully fine times together. You&#8217;ll love it, I
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She won&#8217;t if she&#8217;s inclined to be seasick,&#8221; said
Margery. &#8220;The trouble with Dolly is that she can never have enough of a
good thing. The higher the wind, the happier Dolly is. She&#8217;ll keep on
until the boat heels away over, and until you think you&#8217;re going over the
next minute&#8211;and she calls that having a good time!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I never heard you begging me to quit, Margery Burton!&#8221;
said Dolly. &#8220;You&#8217;re an old fraud&#8211;that&#8217;s what you are!
You pretend you are terribly frightened, and all the time you&#8217;re enjoying
it just as much as I am. I wish there was some way we could have a race.
That&#8217;s where the real fun comes in with a sail boat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You could get all the racing you want over at Bay City, Dolly. The
yacht club there has races every week, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Miss Eleanor would never let me sail in one of those races,
Margery. I guess she&#8217;s right, too. I may be pretty good for a girl, but
I&#8217;m <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span> afraid I
wouldn&#8217;t have a chance with those men.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margery pretended to faint.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to that, will you?&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;Here&#8217;s
Dolly actually saying that someone might be able to do something better than she
could! I&#8217;ll believe in almost anything after that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you can laugh all you like,&#8221; said Dolly, with spirit.
&#8220;But if we should have a race, I&#8217;ll be captain, and I know some
people who won&#8217;t get a chance to be even on the crew. They&#8217;ll feel
pretty sorry they were so fresh, I guess, when they have to stay ashore cooking
dinner while I and my crew are out in the sloop!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then from the beach came the primitive call to breakfast&#8211;made by the
simple process of pounding very hard on the bottom of a frying pan with a big
tin spoon. That ended the talk about Dolly&#8217;s qualifications as a yacht
captain, and there was a wild rush to the beach, and to the tents, since those
who had been in for an early swim could not sit down to breakfast in their wet
bathing <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span> suits. But
no one took any great length of time to dress, since here the utmost simplicity
ruled in clothes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what&#8217;s the programme for to-day, girls?&#8221; asked
Eleanor, after the meal was over.</p>

<p>&#8220;Each for herself!&#8221; cried half a dozen voices. And a broken
chorus rose in agreement.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to fish!&#8221; cried one.</p>

<p>&#8220;A long walk for me!&#8221; cried another.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to make up a party to go over to Bay City and buy
things. We haven&#8217;t been near a store for weeks!&#8221; suggested
another.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;Everyone can do exactly what
she likes between the time we finish clearing up after lunch and dinner. I think
we&#8217;ll have the same rule we did at Long Lake&#8211;four girls attend to
the camp work each day, while the other eight do as they like. You can draw lots
or arrange it among yourselves, I don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s a fine arrangement,&#8221; said Dolly.
&#8220;It&#8217;s a little harder for the four who work than <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span> it would be if we all
pitched in, but no one really has to work any harder, for all that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s even in the long run,&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;And it
gives some of you a chance to do things that call for a whole afternoon. All
agreed to that, are you?&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Eleanor&#8217;s habit, whenever possible, to submit such minor details
of camp life to a vote of the girls. Her authority, of course, was complete. If
she gave an order, it had to be obeyed, and she had the right, if she decided it
was best, to send any or all of the girls home. But&#8211;and many guardians
find it a good plan&#8211;she preferred to give the girls a good deal of
latitude and real independence.</p>

<p>One result was that, whenever she did give a positive order, it was obeyed
unquestioningly. The girls knew by experience that usually she was content to
suggest things, and even agree to methods that she herself would not have
chosen, and, as they were not accustomed to receiving positive orders on all
sorts of subjects, they understood <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_118'></a>118</span> without being told that there was a good reason for
those that were issued. Another result, of course, and the most important, was
that the girls, growing used to governing themselves, grew more self-reliant,
and better fitted to cope with emergencies.</p>

<p>The girls were still washing the breakfast dishes when Marcia Bates walked
along the beach and was greeted with a merry hail by Dolly and the others.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m here as an ambassador or something like that,&#8221; she
announced. &#8220;That little sloop out there is yours, isn&#8217;t
she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll have ours here as soon as it&#8217;s towed over from
Bay City. And we want to challenge you to a regular yacht race. I asked Miss
Turner if we might, and she said yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that would be fine sport,&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;Dolly
Ransom is skipper of our sloop. Suppose you talk it over with her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it would be fine, Marcia!&#8221; said Dolly, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span> with shining eyes.
&#8220;I was just wishing for a race this morning. When shall we have
it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not this afternoon?&#8221; asked Marcia. &#8220;We could race out
to the lighthouse on the rock out there and back. That&#8217;s not very far, but
it&#8217;s far enough to make a good race, I should think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid!&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;What sort of a boat is
yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the same as yours, I think. We can see when they come, and if one
is bigger than the other, we can arrange about a handicap. Miss Turner said she
thought she ought to be in one boat, and Miss Mercer in the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so, too. And I&#8217;ll be skipper of our boat, and have
Bessie King and Margery Burton for a crew. Who is your skipper?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gladys Cooper,&#8221; answered Marcia, after a slight pause.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bully for her! Just you tell her I&#8217;m going to beat her so badly
she won&#8217;t even know she&#8217;s in a race.&#8221;</p>

<p>Marcia laughed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>&#8220;All
right,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;ll let you know when we&#8217;re
ready.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, then, Bessie,&#8221; said Dolly, &#8220;just you come out with me
to the sloop in that skiff, and I&#8217;ll show you just what you&#8217;ll have
to do. It won&#8217;t be hard&#8211;you&#8217;ll only have to obey orders. But
you&#8217;d better know the names of the ropes, so that you&#8217;ll understand
my orders when I give them.&#8221;</p>

<p>So for an hour Bessie, delighted with the appearance of the trim little
sloop, took lessons from Dolly in the art of handling small sailing craft.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get along all right,&#8221; said Dolly, as they pulled
back to the beach. &#8220;Don&#8217;t get excited. That&#8217;s the only thing
to remember. We&#8217;ll wear our bathing suits, of course, so that if we get
spilled into the water, there&#8217;ll be no harm done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a good chance of being spilled, too,&#8221; said
Margery. &#8220;I know how Dolly likes to sail a boat. So if you don&#8217;t
want a ducking, you&#8217;d better make her take someone else in your
place.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>&#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t miss it for anything,&#8221; said Bessie, happily.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve never even seen a yacht race. I bet it must be lots of
fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be rough, anyhow,&#8221; said Eleanor, after they had
landed. She looked out to sea. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty hazy out there, Dolly.
Think there&#8217;ll be enough wind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes,&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;Plenty! It won&#8217;t be stiff, of
course, and we won&#8217;t make good time, but that doesn&#8217;t make any
difference. It&#8217;s as good for them as for us&#8211;and the other way
round.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span><a id='link_8'></a>CHAPTER VIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE RACE</span></h2>

<p>The sloop that was to represent the Halsted Camp Fire in the race arrived in
the cove late in the morning, and from the shore there seemed to be no
difference in size between the two little craft. They were different, and one
might prove swifter than the other, for no two boats of that sort were ever
exactly alike. But so far as could be judged, the race was likely to be a test
rather of how the boats were sailed than of their speed, boat for boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you can sail on even terms, Dolly,&#8221; said Eleanor.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe there&#8217;ll be any need for either of you to
give away any time to the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad of that, Miss Eleanor,&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;It
seems much nicer when you&#8217;re exactly even at the start.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_124'></a>124</span>&#8220;Here&#8217;s Miss Turner now,&#8221; said
Bessie. &#8220;I guess they must be about ready to start. I hope I&#8217;ll do
the right thing when you tell me, Dolly, but I&#8217;m dreadfully afraid I
won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it, and you&#8217;ll be much more likely to
get along well,&#8221; said Margery Burton, calmly. &#8220;And remember that
this race isn&#8217;t the most important thing in the world, even if Dolly
thinks it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s all right for you to talk that way now,&#8221; said
Dolly. &#8220;But wait till we&#8217;re racing, Bessie, You&#8217;ll find
she&#8217;s just as much worked up about it then as I am&#8211;and probably more
so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, all ready, Nell?&#8221; asked Mary Turner, coming up to them
then. &#8220;Gladys seems to think she&#8217;s about ready to start, so I
thought I&#8217;d walk over and arrange about the details.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think the best way to fix up the start will be for the two sloops to
reach the opening in the bar together,&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;They can
start there and finish there, you see, and that will save the need of having
someone to take the time. We <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_125'></a>125</span> really haven&#8217;t anyone who can do that
properly. If we&#8217;re close together at the start you and I can call to one
another and agree upon the moment when the race has actually begun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Miss Turner. &#8220;I&#8217;d thought of that
myself.&#8221; She lowered her voice. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t like to oppose this
race, Nell,&#8221; she said, speaking so that only Eleanor could hear her,
&#8220;but I&#8217;m not at all sure that it&#8217;s going to be a good
thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not? I thought it would be good sport.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It ought to be, but I don&#8217;t know how good a sportsman Gladys is.
If she wins, it will probably make her feel a lot better. But if she
loses&#8211;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of that side of it,&#8221; said Eleanor.
&#8220;But&#8211;oh, well, even so, I think it will probably be a good thing.
Gladys has got a lot of hard lessons to learn, and if this is one of them, the
sooner she learns it, the better. You and I will be along to see fair play. That
will <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126'></a>126</span> keep her from
having anything to say if she does lose, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in for it, anyhow, so I didn&#8217;t mean to have you
worry about it. I think anything that I might have done to stop the race would
have done more harm than the race itself can possibly do, in any
case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m quite sure of that, Mary. Well, we&#8217;ll get aboard our
yacht and you&#8217;d better do the same. They&#8217;re probably waiting
impatiently for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>The flat-bottomed skiff that Bessie had despised proved handy for carrying
the <i>Eleanor&#8217;s</i> crew out to her. While the others climbed aboard,
Dolly, who insisted upon attending to everything herself when she possibly
could, arranged a floating anchor that would keep the boat in place against
their return, and a few moments later the <i>Eleanor&#8217;s</i> snowy sails
rose, flapping idly in the faint breeze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Get up that anchor!&#8221; directed Dolly. &#8220;Bessie, you help
Margery. She&#8217;ll show you what to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a shiver shook the little craft, the wind filled the sails, and in a few
moments they were <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
creeping slowly toward the opening in the bar. Seated at the helm, Dolly looked
over toward the other camp and saw that the other yacht was also under way.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do they call their boat?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>Defiance</i>,&#8221; said Eleanor.</p>

<p>Dolly laughed at the answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I bet I know who named her!&#8221; she said, merrily. &#8220;If that
isn&#8217;t just like Gladys Cooper! Well, I want a good race, and I can have
just as much fun if we&#8217;re beaten, as long as I can feel that I
haven&#8217;t made any mistakes in sailing the <i>Eleanor</i>. But&#8211;well, I
guess I would like to beat Gladys. I bet she&#8217;s awfully sure of
winning!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s had more experience in sailing boats like these than you
have, Dolly,&#8221; said Eleanor.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s welcome to it,&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;I shan&#8217;t
make any excuses if I lose. I&#8217;ll be ready to admit that she&#8217;s better
than I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two boats converged together upon the opening in the bar, and soon those
on one could see everything aboard the other. Gladys Cooper, <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span> like Dolly, sat at the
helm, steering her boat, and a look of grim determination was in her eyes and on
her unsmiling face.</p>

<p>&#8220;She certainly does want to win,&#8221; said Margery.
&#8220;She&#8217;s taking this too seriously&#8211;score one for
Dolly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think she&#8217;d do better if she weren&#8217;t so worked up,
Margery?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course she would! There are just two ways to take a race or a
sporting contest of any sort&#8211;as a game or as a bit of serious work. If you
do the very best you can and forget about winning, you&#8217;ll win a good deal
oftener than you lose, if your best is any good at all. It&#8217;s that way in
football. I&#8217;ve heard boys say that when they have played against certain
teams, they&#8217;ve known right after the start that they were going to win,
because the other team&#8217;s players would lose their tempers the first time
anything went wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We seem to be on even terms now,&#8221; said Eleanor, and, cupping her
hands, she hailed Mary <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_129'></a>129</span> Turner. &#8220;All right? We might as well call
this a start.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Mary. &#8220;Shall I give the word!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead!&#8221; said Eleanor.</p>

<p>Instantly Dolly, with a quick look at her sails, which were hanging limp
again, since she had altered the course a trifle, became all attention.</p>

<p>&#8220;One&#8211;two&#8211;three&#8211;go!&#8221; called Miss Turner,
clapping her hands at the word &#8220;go.&#8221;</p>

<p>And instantly Dolly shifted her helm once more, so that the wind filled the
sails, and the <i>Eleanor</i> shot for the opening in the bar. Quick as she had
been, however, she was no quicker than Gladys, and the <i>Defiance</i> and the
<i>Eleanor</i> passed through the bar and out into the open sea together. Here
there was more motion, since the short, choppy waves outside the bar were never
wholly still, no matter how calm the sea might seem to be. But Bessie, who had
been rather nervous as to the effect of this motion, which she had been warned
to dread, found it by no means unpleasant.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>For a few
moments Dolly&#8217;s orders flew sharply. Although the wind was very light,
there was enough of it to give fair speed, and the sails had to be trimmed to
get the utmost possible out of it while it lasted. Both boats tacked to
starboard, sailing along a slanting line that seemed likely to carry them far to
one side of the lighthouse that was their destination, and Bessie wondered at
this.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not sailing straight for the lighthouse,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that supposed to be where we turn? Don&#8217;t we have to
sail around it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but we can&#8217;t go straight there, because the wind
isn&#8217;t right,&#8221; explained Dolly. &#8220;We&#8217;ll keep on this way
for a spell; then we&#8217;ll come about and tack to port, and then to starboard
again. In that way we can beat the wind, you see, and make it work for us, even
if it doesn&#8217;t want to.&#8221;</p>

<p>Half way to the lighthouse there was less than a hundred feet between the
boats. The <i>Defiance</i> seemed to be a little ahead, but the advantage, if
she really had one at all, was not enough to have any real effect on the
race.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>&#8220;Going out
isn&#8217;t going to give either of us much chance to gain, I guess,&#8221; said
Dolly. &#8220;The real race will be when we&#8217;re going back, with what wind
there is behind us.&#8221;</p>

<p>But soon it seemed that Dolly had made a rash prediction, for when she came
about and started to beat up to port, the <i>Defiance</i> held to her
course.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, she can do that if she wants to,&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;Just
the same, I think she&#8217;s going too far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks to me as if she were pretty sure of what she&#8217;s doing,
though, Dolly,&#8221; said Margery, anxiously. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think you
tacked a little too soon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I thought that I wouldn&#8217;t have done it, Margery,&#8221; said
Dolly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t bother me with silly questions now; I&#8217;ve got to
figure on tacking again so as to make that turn with the least possible waste of
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk to the &#8216;man&#8217; at the wheel,&#8221; advised
Eleanor, with a laugh. &#8220;She&#8217;s irritable.&#8221;</p>

<p>A good many of the nautical terms used so freely <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span> by the others might have been so much
Greek for all Bessie could understand of them, but the race itself had awakened
her interest and now held it as scarcely anything she had ever done had been
able to do.</p>

<p>She kept her eyes fixed on the other boat, and at last she gave a cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look! They&#8217;re going to turn now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Score one for Gladys, Margery,&#8221; said Dolly, quietly.
&#8220;She&#8217;s certainly stolen a march on me. Do you see that? She&#8217;s
going to make her turn on the next tack, and I believe she&#8217;ll gain nearly
five minutes on us. That was clever, and it was good work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, Dolly,&#8221; said Margery. &#8220;You&#8217;ve still got
a chance to catch her going home before the wind. I know how fast the
<i>Eleanor</i> is at that sort of work. If the <i>Defiance</i> is any better,
she ought to be racing for some real cups.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t try to cheer me up! I made an awful mess of that,
Margery, and I know it. Gladys had more nerve than I, that&#8217;s all. She
deserves <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span> the lead
she&#8217;s got. It isn&#8217;t a question of the boats, at all. The
<i>Defiance</i> is being sailed better than the <i>Eleanor</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Margery&#8217;s right, though, Dolly,&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;The
race isn&#8217;t over yet. You haven&#8217;t given up hope, have you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Given up?&#8221; cried Dolly, scornfully, through set teeth.
&#8220;Just you watch, that&#8217;s all! I&#8217;m going to get home ahead if I
have to swamp us all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s more like her,&#8221; Margery whispered to Bessie.</p>

<p>And now even Bessie could see that the <i>Defiance</i> had gained a big
advantage. Before her eyes, not so well trained as those of the others to weigh
every consideration in such a contest, had not seen what was really happening.
But it was plain enough now. Even while the <i>Defiance</i> was holding on for
the lighthouse, on a straight course, the <i>Eleanor</i> had to come about and
start beating up toward it, and the <i>Defiance</i> made the turn, and, with
spinnaker set, was skimming gaily for home <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_134'></a>134</span> a full five minutes before the <i>Eleanor</i>
circled lighthouse.</p>

<p>In fact, the <i>Defiance</i>, homeward bound, passed them, and Mary Turner
laughed gaily as she hailed Eleanor.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is pretty bad,&#8221; she called. &#8220;Better luck next time,
Nell!&#8221;</p>

<p>Marcia Bates waved her hand gaily to them, but Gladys Cooper, her eyes
straight ahead, her hand on the tiller, paid no attention to them. There was no
mistaking the look of triumph on her face, however. She was sure she was going
to win, and she was glorying in her victory already.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll make her smile on the other side of her face yet,&#8221;
said Dolly, viciously. &#8220;She might have waved her hand, at least. If
we&#8217;re good enough to race with, we&#8217;re good enough for her to be
decently polite to us, I should think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Easy, Dolly!&#8221; said Margery. &#8220;It won&#8217;t help any for
you to lose your temper, you know. Remember you&#8217;ve still got to sail your
boat.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span>The
<i>Defiance</i> was far ahead when, at last, after a wait that seemed to those
on board interminable, the <i>Eleanor</i> rounded the lighthouse in her
turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lively now!&#8221; commanded Dolly. &#8220;Shake out the spinnaker!
We&#8217;re going to need all the sail we&#8217;ve got. There isn&#8217;t enough
wind now to make a flag stand out properly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And they got the best of it, too,&#8221; lamented Margery. &#8220;You
see, Bessie, the good wind there was when they started back carried them well
along. We won&#8217;t get that, and we&#8217;ll keep falling further and further
behind, because they&#8217;ve probably still got more wind than we have.
It&#8217;ll die out here before it does where they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dolly stood up now, and cast her eyes behind her on the horizon, and all
about. And suddenly, without warning, she put the helm over, and the
<i>Eleanor</i> stood off to port, heading, as it seemed, far from the opening in
the bar that was the finishing, line.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dolly, are you crazy?&#8221; exclaimed Margery. &#8220;This is a
straight run before the wind!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>&#8220;Suppose
there isn&#8217;t any wind?&#8221; asked Dolly. The strained, anxious look had
left her eyes, and she seemed calm now, almost elated. &#8220;Margery,
you&#8217;re a fine cook, but you&#8217;ve got a lot to learn yet about sailing
a boat!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie was completely mystified, and a look at Margery showed her that she,
too, although silenced, was far from being satisfied. But now Margery suddenly
looked off on the surface of the water, and gave a glad cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, fine, Dolly!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I see what you&#8217;re
up to&#8211;and I bet Gladys thinks you&#8217;re perfectly insane,
too!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll soon know I&#8217;m not,&#8221; said Dolly, grimly.
&#8220;I only hope she doesn&#8217;t know enough to do the same thing. I
don&#8217;t see how she can miss, though, unless she can&#8217;t see in
time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Still Bessie was mystified, and she did not like to ask for an explanation,
especially since she felt certain that one would be forthcoming anyhow in a few
moments. And, sure enough, it was. For suddenly she felt a breath of wind, and,
at the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span> same
instant Dolly brought the <i>Eleanor</i> up before the wind again, and for the
first time Bessie understood what the little sloop&#8217;s real speed was.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see, Bessie,&#8221; said Margery, &#8220;Dolly knew that the wind
was dying. It&#8217;s a puffy, uncertain sort of wind, and very often, on a day
like this, there&#8217;ll be plenty of breeze in one spot, and none at all in
another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, so we came over here to find this breeze!&#8221; said Bessie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It was the only chance. If we had stayed on the other course we
might have found enough breeze to carry us home, but we would have gone at a
snail&#8217;s pace, just as we were doing, and there was no chance at all to
catch Gladys and the <i>Defiance</i> that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t caught them yet, you know,&#8221; said Dolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we&#8217;re catching them,&#8221; said Bessie, exultingly.
&#8220;Even I can see that. Look! They&#8217;re just crawling along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, even at the rate they&#8217;re going, ten minutes <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span> more will bring them to
the finish,&#8221; said Margery, anxiously. &#8220;Do you think she can make it,
Dolly?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve done all I
can, anyhow. There isn&#8217;t a thing to do now but hold her steady and trust
to this shift of the wind to last long enough to carry us home.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now the <i>Eleanor</i> was catching the <i>Defiance</i> fast, and nearing her
more and more rapidly. It was a strange and mysterious thing to Bessie to see
that of two yachts so close together&#8211;there was less than a quarter of a
mile between them now&#8211;one could have her sails filled with a good breeze
while the other seemed to have none at all. But it was so. The <i>Defiance</i>
was barely moving; she seemed as far from the finish now as she had been when
Margery spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re stuck&#8211;they&#8217;re becalmed,&#8221; said Margery,
finally, when five minutes of steady gazing hadn&#8217;t shown the slightest
apparent advance by the <i>Defiance</i>. &#8220;Oh, Dolly, we&#8217;re going to
beat them!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>&#8220;I guess
we are,&#8221; said Dolly, with a sigh of satisfaction. &#8220;It was about the
most hopeless looking race I ever saw twenty minutes ago, but you never can
tell.&#8221;</p>

<p>And now every minute seemed to make the issue more and more certain.
Sometimes a little puff of wind would strike the <i>Defiance</i>, fill her
sails, and push her a little nearer her goal, but the hopes that those puffs
must have raised in Dolly&#8217;s rival and her crew were false, for each died
away before the <i>Defiance</i> really got moving again.</p>

<p>And at last, passing within a hundred yards, so that they could see poor
Gladys, her eyes filled with tears, the <i>Eleanor</i> slipped by the
<i>Defiance</i> and took the lead. And then, by some strange irony of fate, the
wind came to the <i>Defiance</i>&#8211;but it came too late. For the
<i>Eleanor</i>, slipping through the water as if some invisible force had been
dragging her, passed through the opening and into the still waters of the cove
fully two hundred feet in the lead.</p>

<p>&#8220;That certainly was your victory, Dolly,&#8221; said <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span> Eleanor. &#8220;If you
hadn&#8217;t found that wind, we&#8217;d still be floundering around somewhere
near the lighthouse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do feel sorry for Gladys, though,&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;It must
have been hard&#8211;when she was so sure that she had won.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span><a id='link_9'></a>CHAPTER IX<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE SPY</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;That was bad luck. You really deserved to win that race,
Gladys,&#8221; Dolly called out, as the <i>Defiance</i> came within hailing
distance of the <i>Eleanor</i> again.</p>

<p>Gladys looked at her old friend but said not a word. It was very plain that
the loss of the race, which she had considered already won, was a severe blow to
her, and she was not yet able, even had she been willing, to say anything.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s very nice of you, Dolly,&#8221; called Mary Turner.
&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t so at all. You sailed your boat very cleverly. We
didn&#8217;t think of going off after the wind until it was too late. I think it
was mighty plucky of you to keep on when we had such a big lead.
Congratulations!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s the use of talking like that?&#8221; cried Gladys,
furiously. &#8220;It was a trick&#8211;that was all <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span> it was! If we had had a real wind all
the way, we&#8217;d have beaten you by half a mile!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, Gladys. It was a trick,&#8221; said Dolly, cheerfully.
&#8220;That&#8217;s just what I said. We&#8217;ll have another race, won&#8217;t
we? And we&#8217;ll pick out a day when the wind is good and strong, so that it
will be just the same for both boats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;d find some other trick to help you win,&#8221; said
Gladys, sulkily. &#8220;Don&#8217;t act like that&#8211;it&#8217;s easy enough
for you to be pleasant. They&#8217;ll all be laughing at me now for not being
able to win when I had such a lead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ashamed of you, Gladys,&#8221; said Mary Turner, blushing
scarlet. &#8220;Dolly, please don&#8217;t think that any of the rest of us feel
as Gladys does. If I&#8217;d known she was such a poor loser, I wouldn&#8217;t
have let her race with you at all. And there won&#8217;t be another race, Gladys
doesn&#8217;t deserve another chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gladys is quite right,&#8221; said Dolly, soberly. &#8220;It&#8217;s
very easy to be nice and generous when <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_143'></a>143</span> you&#8217;ve won; it&#8217;s much harder to be fair
when you&#8217;ve lost. And it was a trick, after all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it wasn&#8217;t, Dolly,&#8221; said Eleanor, seriously. &#8220;It
was perfectly fair. It was good strategy, but it wasn&#8217;t tricky at all.
Gladys knew just as much about the wind as you did. If she had done as you did
in time, instead of waiting until after she&#8217;d seen you do it, she would
have won the race.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have trouble with that Gladys Cooper yet,&#8221;
said Margery. &#8220;She&#8217;s spoiled, and she&#8217;s got a nasty
disposition to start with, anyhow. You&#8217;d better look out, Dolly,
She&#8217;ll do anything she can to get even.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think this race was one of the things she thought would help her to
get even,&#8221; said Bessie. &#8220;She was awfully sure she was going to be
able to beat you, Dolly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I almost wish she had,&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;I don&#8217;t mean
that I would have done anything to let her win, of course, because there
wouldn&#8217;t be any fun about that. But what&#8217;s an old race,
anyhow!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_144'></a>144</span>&#8220;That&#8217;s the right spirit, Dolly,&#8221;
said Eleanor. &#8220;It&#8217;s the game that counts, not the result. We ought
to play to win, of course, but we ought to play fair first of all. And I think
that means not doing anything at all that would spoil the other side&#8217;s
chances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s all right,&#8221; said Margery, &#8220;but I&#8217;m
glad we won.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad,&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;And I&#8217;m sorry, too.
That sounds silly, doesn&#8217;t it, but it&#8217;s what I mean. Maybe if Gladys
had won, we could have patched things up. And now there&#8217;ll be more trouble
than ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>While they talked they were furling the <i>Eleanor&#8217;s</i> sails, and
soon they were ready to go ashore. Dolly had brought them up cleverly beside the
skiff, and, once the anchor was dropped and everything on board the swift little
sloop had been made snug for the night, they dropped over into the skiff and
rowed to the beach. There the other girls, who had been greatly excited during
the race, and were overjoyed by the result, greeted <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span> them with the Wo-he-lo song. Zara,
especially, seemed delighted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I felt so bad that I cried when I thought you were going to be
beaten,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Oh, Bessie, I&#8217;m glad you won! And I bet it
was because you were on board.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better not let Dolly hear you say that,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;I didn&#8217;t have a thing to do with it, Zara. It was all Dolly&#8217;s
cleverness that won that race.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m awfully glad you&#8217;re back, Bessie. I&#8217;ve had the
strangest feeling this afternoon&#8211;as if someone were watching
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie grew grave at once. Although she never shared them, she had grown
chary of laughing at Zara&#8217;s premonitions and feelings. They had been
justified too often by what happened after she spoke of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean, dear!&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see how
anyone could be around without being seen. It&#8217;s very open.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>&#8220;I
don&#8217;t know, but I&#8217;ve had the feeling, I&#8217;m sure of that.
It&#8217;s just as if someone had known exactly what I was doing, as long as I
was out here on the beach. But when I went into the tent, it stopped. That made
me feel that I must be right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe you&#8217;re mistaken, Zara. You know we&#8217;ve had so
many strange things happen to us lately that it would be funny if it
hadn&#8217;t made you nervous. You&#8217;re probably imagining this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Though Bessie tried thus to disarm Zara&#8217;s suspicions, she was by no
means easy in her own mind. She felt that it would be a good thing to induce
Zara to forget her presentiment, or feeling, or whatever it was, if she could.
But, just the same, she determined to be on her guard, and she spoke to
Dolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s a queer case, that Zara,&#8221; said Dolly, with a little
shiver. &#8220;If any other girl I knew said anything like that, I&#8217;d just
laugh at her. But Zara&#8217;s different, somehow. She seems sort <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span> of mysterious. Perhaps
it&#8217;s just because she&#8217;s a foreigner&#8211;I don&#8217;t
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I spoke to you so that we could be on the lookout, Dolly. And I guess
we&#8217;d better not say anything to anyone else. I think a lot of the girls
would laugh at Zara if they knew that she had such ideas.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie and Dolly managed to find occasion to cover most of the beach before
supper, and they went up to the spring at the top of the bluff that overlooked
the beach. The water had been piped down, and there was no longer any need of
carrying pails up there to get water, but it was still a pleasant little walk,
for the view from the top of the path was delightful. And Bessie and Dolly
remembered, moreover, that it was there that the men who had watched the camp on
the night of the fire had hidden themselves. But this time they found no one
there.</p>

<p>Supper was a merry meal. The race of the afternoon was, of course, the
principal topic of conversation, and in addition there were adventures to <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span> be told by those who had
missed it and gone into Bay City to shop.</p>

<p>But Bessie, watching Zara, noticed toward the end of the meal that her
strange little friend, who happened to be sitting near the entrance of the tent
in which they ate, was nervous and kept looking behind her out into the darkness
as if she saw something. And so, with a whispered explanation to Dolly, she rose
and crept very silently toward the door. As she passed Zara, she let her hand
fall reassuringly on her shoulder, and then, gathering herself, sprang out into
the night.</p>

<p>And, so completely surprised by her sudden appearance that he could not get
out of the way, there was Jake Hoover! Jake Hoover, who was supposed to be in
the city, telling his story to Charlie Jamieson! Jake Hoover, who, after having
done all sorts of dirty work for Holmes and his fellow-conspirators, had told
Bessie that he was sorry and was going to change sides!</p>

<p>&#8220;Jake!&#8221; said Bessie, sternly. &#8220;You miserable sneak! What
are you doing here!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>No wonder poor
Zara had had that feeling of being watched. Jake&#8217;s work for Holmes right
along had been mostly that of the spy, and here he was once more engaged in it.
Bessie was furious at her discovery. Big and strong as Jake was, he was
whimpering now, and Bessie seized him and shook him by the shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me what you&#8217;re doing here right away!&#8221; commanded
Bessie. Gone were the days when she had feared him&#8211;the well-remembered
days of her bondage on the Hoover farm, when his word had always been enough to
secure her punishment at the hands of his mother, who had never been able to see
the evil nature of her boy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ain&#8217;t doin&#8217; no harm&#8211;honest I ain&#8217;t,
Bessie,&#8221; he whined. &#8220;I&#8211;jest wanted&#8211;I jest wanted to see
you and Miss Mercer&#8211;honest, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a likely story, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Bessie,
scornfully. &#8220;If that was so, why did you come sneaking around like this?
Why didn&#8217;t you come <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_150'></a>150</span> right out and ask for us? You didn&#8217;t think we
were going to eat you, did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I didn&#8217;t want them to know I was doin&#8217; it,
Bess,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m scared, Bessie&#8211;I&#8217;m afraid of
what they&#8217;d do to me, if they found out I was takin&#8217; your side
agin&#8217; them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite herself, Bessie felt a certain pity for the coward coming over her.
She released his shoulder, and stood looking at him with infinite scorn in her
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;And to think I was ever afraid of you!&#8221; she said, aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Bess,&#8221; he said, pleadingly. &#8220;I
wouldn&#8217;t hurt you&#8211;you know that, don&#8217;t you? I used to like to
tease you and worry you a bit, but I never meant any real harm. I was always
good to you, mostly, wasn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dolly!&#8221; called Bessie, sharply. She didn&#8217;t know just what
to do, and she felt that, having Jake here, he should be held. It had been plain
that Charlie Jamieson had considered what he had to tell valuable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>&#8220;Hello!
Did you call me, Bessie?&#8221; said Dolly, coming out of the tent.
&#8220;Oh!&#8221;</p>

<p>The exclamation was wrung out of her as she saw and recognized Jake.</p>

<p>&#8220;So he&#8217;s spying around here now, is he?&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
told you he was a bad lot when you let him go at Windsor, didn&#8217;t I? I knew
he&#8217;d be up to his old tricks again just as soon as he got half a
chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind that, Dolly. Tell Miss Eleanor he&#8217;s here, will you,
and ask her to come out! I think she&#8217;d better see him, now that he&#8217;s
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right&#8211;and, say, tell her to hurry, will you?&#8221;
begged Jake. &#8220;I can&#8217;t stay here&#8211;I&#8217;m afraid they&#8217;ll
catch me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dolly went into the tent again, and in a moment Eleanor Mercer came out. She
had never seen Jake before, but she knew all about him for Bessie and Zara had
told her enough of his history for her to be more intimate with his life than
his own parents.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, Jake,&#8221; she said, as she saw <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span> him. &#8220;So you decided to talk to
us instead of to Mr. Jamieson? Well, I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re here,
I&#8217;ll have to keep you waiting a minute, but I shan&#8217;t be long. Stay
right there till I come back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am,&#8221; whined Jake. &#8220;But do hurry, please,
ma&#8217;am! I&#8217;m afraid of what they&#8217;ll do to me if they find
I&#8217;m here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor was gone only a few minutes, and when she returned she was smiling,
as if at some joke that she shared with no one.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure you haven&#8217;t had any supper, Jake,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;The girls have finished. See, they&#8217;re coming out now. Come
inside, and I&#8217;ll see that you get a good meal. You&#8217;ll be able to
talk better when you&#8217;ve eaten.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jake hesitated, plainly struggling between his hunger and his fear. But
hunger won, and he went into the tent, followed by Bessie and Dolly, who,
although the service was reluctant on Dolly&#8217;s part, at least, saw to it
that he had plenty to eat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just forget your troubles and pitch into that <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span> food, Jake,&#8221; said Eleanor,
kindly. &#8220;You&#8217;ll be able to talk much better on a full stomach, you
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>And whenever Jake seemed inclined to stop eating, and to break out with new
evidences of his alarm, they forced more food on him. At last, however, he was
so full that he could eat no more, and he rose nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to be going now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Honest,
I&#8217;m afraid to stay here any longer&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but you came here to tell us something, you know,&#8221; said
Eleanor. &#8220;Surely you&#8217;re not going away without doing that, are
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did think you&#8217;d keep your word, Jake,&#8221; said Bessie,
reproachfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t! I&#8217;ve got to go, I tell you!&#8221; Jake broke
out. His fright was not assumed; it was plain that he was terrified. &#8220;If
they was after you, I guess you&#8217;d know&#8211;here, I&#8217;m
going&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so fast, young man!&#8221; said a stern voice in the door of the
tent, and Jake almost collapsed as Bill Trenwith, a policeman in uniform at his
back, came in. &#8220;There you are, Jones, there&#8217;s <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span> your man. Arrest him on a charge of
having no means of support&#8211;that will hold him for the present. We can
decide later on what we want to send him to prison for. He&#8217;s done enough
to get him twenty years.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jake gave a shriek of terror and fell to the ground, grovelling at the
lawyer&#8217;s feet.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t arrest me!&#8221; he begged. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell
you everything I know. Don&#8217;t arrest me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the only way to hold you,&#8221; said Trenwith.
&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to learn to be more afraid of us than of
Holmes.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span><a id='link_10'></a>CHAPTER X<br /><span class='h2fs'>JAKE HOOVER&#8217;S CAPTURE</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a fine lot,&#8221; declared Jake, something about
Trenwith&#8217;s manner seeming to steady him so that he could talk
intelligibly. &#8220;You tell me I won&#8217;t get into any trouble if I come
here, and then I find it&#8217;s a trap!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one told you anything of the sort, my lad,&#8221; said Trenwith,
sharply. &#8220;You promised to go to Mr. Jamieson and tell him what you knew.
No one made you any promises at all, except that you were told you
wouldn&#8217;t have any reason to regret doing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jake looked at Eleanor balefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s too sharp, that&#8217;s what she is,&#8221; he complained
bitterly. &#8220;I might ha&#8217; known she was playing a trick on
me&#8211;gettin&#8217; me to stay here and eat a fine supper. I suppose she went
and sent word to you while I was doing it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>&#8220;Of course
I did, Jake,&#8221; said Eleanor quietly. &#8220;I telephoned to Mr. Trenwith
even before you had your supper because I knew that if I didn&#8217;t do
something to keep you here with us, you&#8217;d run away again. But I did it as
much for your sake as for Bessie&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you did&#8211;not!&#8221; said Jake. &#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t
you let me go now, then, if that is so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen to me, my buck,&#8221; said Trenwith, sternly.
&#8220;You&#8217;re not going to do yourself any good by getting fresh to this
lady, I can tell you that. You&#8217;re pretty well scared, aren&#8217;t you?
You told her that you were afraid of what Holmes would do to you?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Jake, alarmed by Trenwith&#8217;s mention of the name of the man he
feared, shut his lips obstinately, and wouldn&#8217;t say a word in answer.
Trenwith smiled cheerfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you needn&#8217;t talk now, unless you want to,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;I know all you could tell me about that, anyhow. You&#8217;ve been up to
some mischief, and <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
they&#8217;ve kept on telling you that if you didn&#8217;t behave yourself
they&#8217;d give you away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jake&#8217;s hangdog look showed that to be true, although he still
maintained his obstinate silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I happen to be charged with enforcing the law around here, and
it&#8217;s my duty to see that criminals are brought to justice. I don&#8217;t
know just what you&#8217;ve done, but I&#8217;ll find out, and I&#8217;ll see
that you are turned over to the proper authorities&#8211;unless you can do
something that will make it worth while to let you off. So, you see,
you&#8217;ve got just as much reason to be afraid of us as of the gang
you&#8217;ve been training with.</p>

<p>&#8220;They won&#8217;t be able to help you now, either, even if they should
want to&#8211;and I don&#8217;t believe they want to, when it comes to that.
I&#8217;ve always found that crooks will desert their best friends if it seems
to them that they&#8217;ll get something out of doing it. So if you&#8217;re
trusting to them to get you out of this scrape, you&#8217;re making a big
mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better listen to what Mr. Trenwith says, Jake,&#8221; said
Eleanor. &#8220;You think I&#8217;ve led you <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_158'></a>158</span> into a trap here. Well, I have, in a way.
You&#8217;ll have to go to jail for a little while, anyhow. But you&#8217;re
safer there than you would be if you were free. We&#8217;re all willing to be
your friends, for your father&#8217;s sake. If we can, we&#8217;ll get you out
of this trouble you are in. But you will have to help us. Think it
over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use?&#8221; said Jake, sullenly. &#8220;I ain&#8217;t
got nothin&#8217; to tell you, because I don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217;.
An&#8217; if I did&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better take him along, Jones,&#8221; said Trenwith to the
policeman. &#8220;It&#8217;s quite evident that we&#8217;ll get nothing out of
him to-night. And I don&#8217;t see any use wasting time on him while he&#8217;s
in this frame of mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so Jake, whining and protesting, was taken away. As soon as he was out of
sight and hearing Trenwith&#8217;s manner changed.</p>

<p>&#8220;By George,&#8221; he said, excitedly, &#8220;that&#8217;s a good piece
of work! There&#8217;s something mighty interesting coming off here pretty soon.
I&#8217;m not at liberty to tell you what it is yet, but I had a <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span> long talk on the
telephone with Charlie just before you called me, Eleanor, and there are going
to be ructions!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I suppose we mustn&#8217;t ask you to tell us, if you&#8217;ve
promised not to do it,&#8221; said Eleanor, &#8220;but I do wish we
knew!&#8221;</p>

<p>She didn&#8217;t seem to notice that he had called her by her first
name&#8211;a privilege that was not accorded, as a rule, to those who had no
more of an acquaintance with her than Billy Trenwith. But he had done it so
naturally, and with so little thought, that she could hardly have resented it,
anyway. But Dolly noticed it, and nudged Bessie mischievously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you really think we&#8217;re going to find something out from
Jake, Mr. Trenwith?&#8221; asked Dolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll find a way to make him talk, never fear,&#8221; said
Trenwith. &#8220;The boy&#8217;s a natural born coward. He&#8217;ll do anything
to save his own skin if he finds he&#8217;s in real trouble and that the others
of his gang can&#8217;t help him. I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s naturally <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span> bad or vicious&#8211;I
think he&#8217;s just weak. He was spoiled by his mother, wasn&#8217;t he? He
acts the way a good many boys do who have been treated that way. He&#8217;s not
got enough strength of character to keep him from taking the easiest path. If a
thing seems safe, he&#8217;s willing to do it to avoid trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know there&#8217;s just one thing that occurs to me,&#8221; said
Eleanor, looking worried. &#8220;Jake may have come here with some vague idea of
telling us what he knew. But suppose he has seen Holmes or some of the others
since Bessie got him to promise to go to Charlie Jamieson in the
city?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hoped you wouldn&#8217;t think of that,&#8221; said Trenwith,
gravely. &#8220;I thought of it, too. You mean he might have been here just as a
spy, with no idea of showing himself at all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The way he acted makes it look as if that was just why he was here,
too,&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;He was sneaking around, and he certainly
didn&#8217;t seem very pleased when Bessie found him.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>&#8220;He did
his best to squirm away,&#8221; said Bessie. &#8220;If Zara hadn&#8217;t been so
nervous while we were eating supper I would never have thought of going after
him, either. But she seems to be able to see things and hear things, in some
queer fashion, when no one else can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good thing for the rest of us,&#8221; said Trenwith
with a smile. &#8220;She&#8217;s a useful person to have around at a time like
this. I&#8217;m going to have a couple of my men&#8211;detectives&#8211;stay
around here to-night to keep an eye on things. It&#8217;s likely, of course,
that there&#8217;s nothing to be afraid of, but just the same, we don&#8217;t
want to take any chances.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;ve done that,&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m the ordinary type of timid woman, but I must confess
that all these things worry me, and I&#8217;ll feel a lot safer if I know that
we are not entirely at the mercy of any trick they try to play on us to-night.
They seem to be getting bolder, all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, after all you know, that&#8217;s one of the most hopeful things
about the whole business. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_162'></a>162</span> It means that they&#8217;re getting
desperate&#8211;that their time is getting short. They feel that if they
don&#8217;t succeed soon they never will, because it will be too late. All
we&#8217;ve got to do is to stand them off a little longer, and the whole
business will be settled and done with.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get back to Bay City to-night. If anything happens,
don&#8217;t hesitate to call me up, no matter what time it is. If I&#8217;m out
at any time you do have to call me, I&#8217;ll leave word where I&#8217;m going,
so that if you tell them at my house who you are, they&#8217;ll find me.
Good-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither Dolly nor Bessie slept well that night. Jake&#8217;s appearance had
been disturbing; it seemed to both of them much more likely that his coming
heralded some new attempt by Holmes, rather than a desire on his part to
confess. But the night passed without anything to rouse them, and in the morning
their fears seemed rather foolish, as fears are apt to do when they are examined
in the sunlight of a new day.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see what they can do, after all,&#8221; said <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span> Dolly. &#8220;There
aren&#8217;t any woods around here as there were at Long Lake. We&#8217;re all
in sight of the camp and of one another all the time, and they certainly
won&#8217;t be able to work that trick of setting the tents on fire
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess you&#8217;re right,&#8221; said Bessie. &#8220;It seems
different this morning, somehow. I was worried enough last night but I feel a
whole lot better now. I&#8217;m glad it&#8217;s such a beautiful day. The
weather makes a lot of difference in the way you feel. It always does with me, I
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going out in the sloop after breakfast,&#8221; said Dolly.
&#8220;That is, if Miss Eleanor says it&#8217;s all right. There&#8217;s a lot
more wind than there was yesterday, and we can have some good fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I go, too?&#8221; asked Bessie. &#8220;You were quite right when
you told me I&#8217;d love the seashore, Dolly. Do you remember how I said I was
sorry we were leaving the mountains?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I knew it would fascinate you, just as it does me. So you&#8217;ve
given up your love for the mountains?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>&#8220;Not a bit
of it! I love them as much as ever, but I&#8217;ve found out that the seashore
has attractive things about it, too. And I think sailing, the way we did
yesterday, is about the nicest of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you just wait until we get out there to-day, with a real breeze,
and a good sea running. That&#8217;s going to be something you&#8217;ve never
even dreamed of.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had hearty appetites for breakfast in spite of their restless and
disturbed sleep, for the bracing effects of their swim, taken before the meal,
more than made up for the lack of proper rest. And after breakfast Dolly asked
permission to go out in the sloop, since one of the very few rules of the Camp
Fire, and one strictly enforced, had to do with water sports.</p>

<p>None of the girls were ever allowed to go in swimming unless the Guardian was
present, and the same rules applied to boating and sailing&#8211;with the added
restriction that no girl who did not know how to swim well enough to pass
certain tests was allowed to go in a boat at all. Moreover, <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span> bathing suits had always to be worn
when in a boat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed you may,&#8221; said Eleanor, when Dolly asked her question.
&#8220;And will you take me with you! I&#8217;d like to be out on that sea
to-day. It looks glorious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll love to have you along,&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;How soon
may we start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s eight o&#8217;clock,&#8221; said Eleanor, looking at her
watch. &#8220;We can start at ten. That will allow plenty of time after eating.
Of course, we don&#8217;t intend to go in the water, but you never can
tell&#8211;it&#8217;s squally to-day, and we might be upset. And that&#8217;s one
thing I don&#8217;t believe in taking chances with. A cramp will make the best
swimmer in the world perfectly helpless in the water, and about every case of
cramps I ever heard of came from going in the water too soon after a
meal.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they were aboard the <i>Eleanor</i> and scooting through the opening in
the bar, Bessie found that the conditions were indeed very different from <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span> those of the previous
afternoon. The wind had changed and become much heavier, and as the
<i>Eleanor</i> went along, she dipped her bow continually, so that the spray
rose and drenched all on board. But there was something splendidly exciting and
invigorating about it, and she loved every new sensation that came to her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s the <i>Defiance</i> coming out,&#8221; said Eleanor,
after they had been enjoying the sport for half an hour. &#8220;Gladys must like
this sort of a breeze, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She does, but she&#8217;s never had as much of it as I have,&#8221;
said Dolly. &#8220;I hope she understands it well enough not to make any
mistakes. A boat like this takes a good deal of handling in a heavy breeze, and
it seems to me that she&#8217;s carrying a good deal of sail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She seems to be getting along all right, though,&#8221; said Eleanor,
after watching the <i>Defiance</i> for a few minutes. &#8220;Why, Dolly, I
wonder what she&#8217;s doing now.&#8221;</p>

<p>The maneuvres of the <i>Defiance</i> seemed strange <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span> enough to prompt Eleanor&#8217;s
question, for, no matter how Dolly tacked, the <i>Defiance</i> followed her,
drawing nearer all the time. Since Dolly had no sort of definite purpose in
mind, it was plain that Gladys was simply following her. And soon the reason was
apparent.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s trying to race; she wants to show that she can beat us
to-day when there&#8217;s plenty of wind,&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;If she
wanted to race, why didn&#8217;t she say so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, give her her way, Dolly,&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;Keep
straight on now for a little while and see if she can beat you. We&#8217;re just
about on even terms now.&#8221;</p>

<p>And on even terms they stayed. Sometimes one, sometimes the other seemed to
gain a little advantage, but it was plain that the boats, as well as the
skippers, were very evenly matched. Since there was no agreement to race, Dolly
had the choice of courses, and in a spirit of mischief she came about
frequently. And every time she changed her course Gladys followed suit.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>Although the
boats were often within easy hailing distance, Gladys avoided Dolly&#8217;s
eyes, and nothing was said by those on either sloop. They were satisfied with
the fun of this impromptu racing. But at last, when they were perhaps a mile
from the opening in the bar, and very close together, Eleanor, looking at her
watch, saw that it was nearly time for lunch.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better turn for home now, Dolly,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Suppose I give Gladys a hail and suggest a race to the bar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; agreed Dolly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gladys!&#8221; Eleanor sent her clear voice across the water, and
Gladys answered with a wave of her hands. She seemed in better humor than she
had been the day before.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going in now. Want to race to the bar?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right!&#8221; called Gladys, in answer and came about smartly. She
had been quick, but Dolly was just as quick, and they were on the most even
terms imaginable as the race began.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>But Dolly and
the <i>Eleanor</i> had one advantage that Gladys was not slow to recognize. The
<i>Eleanor</i> had the inside course. In a close finish that would be very
likely to spell the difference between victory and defeat, since, to reach the
opening, Gladys would either have to get far enough ahead to cross the
<i>Eleanor&#8217;s</i> bows or else to cross behind her, which would entail so
much loss of time that Dolly would be certain to bring her craft home a winner.
But since the previous racing had shown the <i>Defiance</i> to be just a trifle
swifter before the wind, that advantage seemed to be one that Gladys could
easily overcome.</p>

<p>Now that she was racing, however, Dolly changed her tactics. Fresh as the
wind was, she shook out a reef in her mainsail, and as they neared the bar the
<i>Eleanor</i> actually carried more canvas than Gladys dared to keep on the
<i>Defiance</i>, Being less used to heavy going than Dolly, she was not so sure
of the strength of her sticks, and reckless though she was, she was too wise to
be willing to take a chance of being dismasted.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span>And so the
advantage that Gladys had to gain to be able to cross the <i>Eleanor&#8217;s</i>
bows seemed to be impossible for her to attain. The <i>Eleanor</i> did not go
ahead, but she held her own, and she had the right of way.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to beat her again, and fair and square this
time,&#8221; said Eleanor, excitedly. &#8220;She won&#8217;t be able to say a
word to this!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look!&#8221; said Dolly, suddenly. &#8220;She&#8217;s going to cross
me&#8211;and she&#8217;s got no right to do it!&#8221; She shouted loudly.
&#8220;Gladys! Gladys! I&#8217;ll run you down! Don&#8217;t do that! I&#8217;ve
got the right of way!&#8221;</p>

<p>But Gladys kept on with a mocking laugh. Furious at the trick, Dolly put her
helm hard over, and the <i>Eleanor</i> came up in the wind.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a mean trick, if you like!&#8221; cried Dolly,
indignantly. &#8220;In a regular race, if she did a thing like that, the other
boat would run her down, and would win on a foul. But she knew very well
I&#8217;d give up the position rather than cause an accident!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>The check to the
<i>Eleanor</i> was only for a moment, but it was enough to throw her off her
course and make it certain that the <i>Defiance</i> would reach the bar
first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind, Dolly. You did the right thing,&#8221; said Eleanor,
quietly. &#8220;I think she&#8217;s quite welcome to the race, if she cares
enough about winning it to play a trick like that!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie was up in the bow, looking intently at the <i>Defiance</i>. And now as
Gladys came up to get the straight course again, something went wrong. By some
mistaken handling of her helm she had lost her proper direction, and to her
amazement Bessie saw the boom come over sharply. She saw it, too, strike Gladys
on the head&#8211;and the next moment the <i>Defiance</i> gybed helplessly,
while Gladys was swept overboard.</p>

<p>Bessie did not hesitate a moment. She had seen that blow struck by the boom,
and with a cry of warning she plunged overboard as they swept by the helpless
<i>Defiance</i>, and with powerful strokes made for the place where Gladys had
gone <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span> overboard.
Gladys had gone straight down, but Bessie had marked the spot, and she dived as
she reached it, and met her coming up. She clutched her in a moment, and was on
the surface almost at once, holding Gladys, and looking for Dolly and the
<i>Eleanor</i>. Dolly would return for her at once, she knew, if she had seen
Gladys go over. But, to her amazement the sloop was heading for the bar, sailing
away from her fast! Dolly had not seen her and, for a moment, Bessie was badly
scared.</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span><a id='link_11'></a>CHAPTER XI<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE RESCUE</span></h2>

<p>In a moment, however, she realized that she could not be left alone for long.
Her absence from the <i>Eleanor</i> would be noticed, even if no one had seen
her leap overboard; and, moreover, the strange behavior of the <i>Defiance</i>
was sure to attract Dolly&#8217;s attention, for, without Gladys to direct her,
the <i>Defiance</i> was in a bad way. She had heeled over sharply, and seemed
now to be sailing in circles, following the errant impulses of the wind, which
caught first one sail, then another.</p>

<p>Although she was quite near the <i>Defiance</i>, Bessie looked for no help
from her. To swim toward her, with Gladys as a burden, seemed hopeless. The boat
was not staying in one position. And moreover, Marcia Bates and the other girl
on board of her seemed almost entirely ignorant of what to do. They would have
quite enough, on <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
their hands in trying to get her headed for the opening in the bar.</p>

<p>And suddenly a new danger was added to the others. For Gladys, it seemed, was
recovering her senses&#8211;or, rather, she was no longer unconscious. To her
horror, Bessie found, as Gladys opened her eyes, that she was delirious. That,
of course, was the effect of the blow on her head from the boom, but its effect,
no matter what the cause, was what worried Bessie.</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep still! Don&#8217;t move, Gladys!&#8221; warned Bessie, as she saw
the other girl&#8217;s eyes open.</p>

<p>But Gladys either would not or could not obey that good advice. She struggled
furiously by way of answer, and for a long minute Bessie was too busy keeping
afloat to be able to look for the coming of the help that was so badly
needed.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no purpose to the struggles of Gladys, but they were none
the less desperate because of that. Her eyes had the wide, fixed stare that, had
Bessie known it, is so invariably <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_175'></a>175</span> seen in those who are in mortal fear of drowning.
And she clung to Bessie with a strength that no one could have imagined her
capable of displaying.</p>

<p>And at last, though she hated to do it, Bessie managed to get her hands free,
and, clenching her fists, she drove them repeatedly into the other&#8217;s face
so that Gladys was forced to let go and put her hands before her face to cover
herself from the vicious blows.</p>

<p>At once Bessie seized the opportunity. She flung herself away, knowing that
even though she did not try to help herself, but being conscious, Gladys would
not sink at once, and got behind her, so that she could grasp her by the
shoulders and be safe from the deadly clutch of her arms.</p>

<p>Free from the terrible danger that is the risk assumed by all who rescue
drowning persons, that of being dragged down by the victim, Bessie was able to
raise her head and look for the <i>Eleanor</i>. And now she gave a wild cry as
she saw the sloop <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
bearing down upon her. Eleanor Mercer was in the bow, a coil of rope in her
hands, and a moment later she flung it skillfully, so that Bessie caught it. At
once Bessie made a noose and slipped the rope over Gladys&#8217;s shoulders.
Then she let go, and, turning on her back, rested while Gladys was dragged
toward the sloop.</p>

<p>Bessie herself was almost exhausted by her struggle. She felt that, had her
very life depended upon doing it, she could not have swam the few yards that
separated her from the sloop. But there was no need for her to do it. Steering
with the utmost skill, Dolly soon brought the <i>Eleanor</i> alongside of Bessie
as she lay floating in the water, and a moment later she was being helped
aboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lie down and rest,&#8221; commanded Eleanor. &#8220;Don&#8217;t try to
talk yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>And Bessie was glad enough to obey. She lay down beside Gladys, who seemed to
have fainted again, and Eleanor threw a rug over her.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>&#8220;Now we
must get them ashore as quickly as we can, Dolly,&#8221; said Eleanor.
&#8220;Bessie&#8217;s just tired out, but I don&#8217;t like the looks of Gladys
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The boom hit her,&#8221; said Bessie, weakly. &#8220;It hit her on the
head. That&#8217;s how she was knocked overboard. She didn&#8217;t know what she
was doing when she struggled so in the water.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a lucky thing you saw what happened!&#8221; said Dolly. &#8220;I
was so intent on the race that I never looked at all, and I didn&#8217;t even
know you&#8217;d gone over until I called to you and you didn&#8217;t
answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I knew you&#8217;d come back, Dolly. I just wondered, when Gladys
was struggling so, if you&#8217;d be in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time Dolly didn&#8217;t stop at the anchorage of the sloop, but ran her
right up on the beach. That meant some trouble in getting her off when they came
to that, but it was no time to hesitate because of trifles. Once they were
ashore, the other girls, who had, of course, seen nothing of the accident <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span> that had so nearly had a
tragic ending, rushed up to help, and in a few moments Gladys was being carried
to the big living tent.</p>

<p>There her wet clothes were taken off, she was rubbed with alcohol, and
wrapped in hot blankets. And as Eleanor and Margery Burton stood over her, she
opened her eyes, looked at them in astonishment, and wanted to know where she
was.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, thank Heaven!&#8221; cried Eleanor. &#8220;She&#8217;s come to her
senses, I do believe! Gladys, do you feel all right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8211;I&#8211;think so,&#8221; said Gladys, faintly, putting her
hand to her head. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got an awful headache. What happened? I seem
to remember being hit on the head&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your boom struck you as it swung over, and knocked you into the water,
Gladys,&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;You couldn&#8217;t swim, and you don&#8217;t
remember anything after that, do you? It dazed you for a time, so that you
didn&#8217;t know what you were doing. But you&#8217;re all right now, though
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span> I&#8217;ve
telephoned for a doctor, and he&#8217;d better have a look at you when he comes,
just to make sure you&#8217;re all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&#8211;how did I get here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bessie King saw you go overboard and jumped after you. Of course, the
girls on your boat were pretty helpless&#8211;she was going all around in
circles after you left the tiller free, so they couldn&#8217;t do
anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gladys closed her eyes for a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to talk to her later&#8211;when I feel better,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll try to go to sleep now, if I may. The pain
in my head is dreadful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s the best thing you can do,&#8221; said Eleanor
warmly. &#8220;You&#8217;ll feel ever so much better, I know, when you wake up.
Someone will be here with you all the time, so that if you wake up and want
anything, you&#8217;ll only need to ask for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Gladys was asleep before Eleanor had finished speaking. Nature was taking
charge of the <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span> case
and prescribing the greatest of all her remedies, sleep.</p>

<p>Eleanor turned away, with relief showing plainly in her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she&#8217;ll be all right now,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If that
blow were going to have any serious effects, I don&#8217;t believe she&#8217;d
be in her senses now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s a good thing it happened, in a way,&#8221; said
Dolly, when they were outside of the tent. &#8220;Did you notice how she spoke
about Bessie, Miss Eleanor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I see what you mean, Dolly. Of course, I&#8217;m sorry she had to
have such an experience, but maybe you&#8217;re right, after all. I&#8217;m
quite sure that her feelings toward Bessie will be changed after
this&#8211;she&#8217;d have to be a dreadful sort of girl if she could keep on
cherishing her dislike and resentment. And I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;s
not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello! Why aren&#8217;t you in bed, sleeping off that ducking?&#8221;
asked Dolly suddenly. For Bessie, in dry clothes, and looking as if she had had
nothing more exciting than an ordinary plunge <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_181'></a>181</span> into the sea to fill her day, was coming toward
them from her own tent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I feel fine!&#8221; said Bessie. &#8220;The only trouble with me
was that I was scared&#8211;just plain scared! If I&#8217;d known that
everything was going to be all right, I could have turned and swam ashore after
you started towing Gladys in. Is she all right? I&#8217;m more bothered about
her than about myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she&#8217;s going to feel a lot better when she wakes
up,&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;I think I&#8217;m enough of a doctor to be able
to tell when there&#8217;s anything seriously wrong. But I&#8217;m not taking
any chances&#8211;I&#8217;ve sent for a doctor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How about the other boat? Did they get in all right?&#8221; asked
Dolly, &#8220;I forgot all about them, I was so worked up about Bessie and
Gladys.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They had a tough time, but they managed it,&#8221; said Margery
Burton. &#8220;Here&#8217;s Miss Turner now. I suppose she&#8217;s worried about
Gladys.&#8221;</p>

<p>Worried she certainly was, but Eleanor was <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_182'></a>182</span> able to reassure her, and soon the doctor, arriving
from Green Cove, pronounced Gladys to be in no danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;ll have that headache when she wakes up,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;but it will be a lot better, and by to-morrow morning it will be gone
altogether. Don&#8217;t give her much to eat; some chicken broth ought to be
enough. She&#8217;s evidently got a good constitution. If she had fractured her
skull she wouldn&#8217;t have been conscious yet, nor for a good many
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the accident had one unforeseen consequence, that was rather amusing than
otherwise to Dolly, at first, at least. For, before the doctor was ready to go,
the sound of an automobile engine was heard up on the bluff, and a minute later
Billy Trenwith came racing down the path.</p>

<p>At the sight of Eleanor he paused, looking a little sheepish.</p>

<p>&#8220;I heard that Doctor Black was coming here&#8211;I was afraid something
might have happened to you,&#8221; he stammered.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>&#8220;Why,
whatever made you think that?&#8221; said Eleanor, honestly puzzled. Then she
turned, surprised again by a burst of hysterical laughter from Dolly, who,
staring at Trenwith&#8217;s red face, was entirely unable to contain her mirth.
Under Eleanor&#8217;s steady gaze she managed to control herself, but then she
went off again helplessly as Doctor Black winked at her very deliberately.</p>

<p>Scandalized and rather indignant as the point of the joke began to reach her,
Eleanor was dismayed to see that Bessie, the grave, was also having a hard time
to keep from laughing outright. So she blushed, which was the last thing in the
world she wanted to do, and then made some excuse for a hasty flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you people have so many things happen to you all the
time,&#8221; said Trenwith, indignantly, &#8220;that I don&#8217;t see why it
wasn&#8217;t perfectly natural for me to come out to see what was wrong
now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don&#8217;t apologize to me, Mr. Trenwith!&#8221; <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span> said Dolly,
mischievously. &#8220;And&#8211;can you keep a secret?&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her, not knowing whether he ought to laugh or frown, and Dolly
went up to him, put her hands on his shoulders, and raised herself so that she
could whisper in his ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;She isn&#8217;t half as angry as she pretends,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>Then Eleanor came back, and Dolly made herself scarce. She had a positive
genius for knowing just how far she could go safely in her teasing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to come out here, anyhow,&#8221; said Trenwith, to Eleanor.
&#8220;Look here. I got this message from Charlie Jamieson.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor took it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see why you let Charlie order you around so,&#8221; she
said, severely. &#8220;Haven&#8217;t you any business of your own to attend to?
He hasn&#8217;t any right to expect you to waste all your time trying to keep us
out of trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn&#8217;t wasted,&#8221; he said, indignantly. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span> &#8220;We&#8217;re
supposed to help our friends&#8211;and we&#8217;re friends, aren&#8217;t
we?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course we are,&#8221; said Eleanor, relenting.</p>

<p>He brightened at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, impulsively, &#8220;you see Charlie says he
doesn&#8217;t want me to let you and those two girls&#8211;Bessie and
Zara&#8211;out of my sight until he comes. Couldn&#8217;t you all come out for a
sail with me in my motor launch? We could have supper on board and it would be
lots of fun, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor looked doubtful.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about leaving the camp,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I
ought to be here to keep an eye on things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you can go perfectly well, Miss Eleanor,&#8221; said Margery
Burton. &#8220;It will do Bessie and Dolly a lot of good if you take
them&#8211;they&#8217;ve had a pretty exciting day. And we can ask all the
Halsted girls over to supper, and Miss Turner will be with them. She can take
your place as Guardian for a few hours, can&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If she will come. Why, yes, that would make <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span> it all right,&#8221; said Eleanor.
Somehow she found that she wasn&#8217;t half as strong-minded and self-reliant
when this very masterful young man was around. &#8220;You might go over and see,
Margery, if you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Splendid!&#8221; said Trenwith. &#8220;We&#8217;ll have a perfectly
bully time, I know. You keep at it too hard, Miss Mercer&#8211;really you
do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t go very far, will we?&#8221; said Eleanor, yielding to
the lure of a sail at sunset.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, no, just a few miles down the coast. There&#8217;s a lot of pretty
scenery you ought to see&#8211;and I&#8217;ve got a man who helps me to run my
boat who&#8217;s a perfect wizard at cooking, We&#8217;ve got a sort of
imitation kitchen on board, but he does things in it that would make the chef of
a big hotel envious. He&#8217;s one of the few things I boast about.&#8221;</p>

<p>Margery soon returned with word that the Halsted girls would accept the
supper invitation, and that Mary Turner would be delighted to come.</p>

<p>Margery&#8217;s eyes were twinkling, and it was plain <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span> that Mary Turner had said something
else that was not to be repeated.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right! That&#8217;s great!&#8221; said Trenwith, happily.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll run back to Green Cove in my car, and come around here again
in the launch. It was to follow me there. I&#8217;ll be back soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed, in half an hour he was back, and Eleanor with Zara, Bessie and Dolly,
were taken out to the <i>Columbia</i> in two trips of the little dinghy which
served as her tender. The <i>Columbia</i> was a big, roomy, motor launch,
without a deck, but containing a little cabin, and a comfortable lounging space
aft, which was covered with an awning.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a delightful boat!&#8221; said Eleanor, as she settled herself
comfortably amid the cushions Trenwith had provided for her. &#8220;I should
think you could have an awfully good time on her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve used her a lot,&#8221; said Trenwith. &#8220;There&#8217;s
room in the cabin for two fellows to sleep, if they don&#8217;t mind being
crowded, and of course in warm weather one can sleep out here. I&#8217;ve used
her quite a lot to go duck hunting, and for little cruises <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span> when I&#8217;ve been all tired out.
Charlie Jamieson has been with me several times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard him talk about the good times he&#8217;s had on her.
It was stupid of me to have forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s not very fast or very fashionable, but she is good fun.
I&#8217;d rather have a steady, slow engine that you can depend on than one of
those racing motors that&#8217;s always getting out of order.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready to start, sir, Mr. Trenwith,&#8221; said Bates, his
&#8216;crew,&#8217; then, and Trenwith took the wheel.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Let her go, Bates! You can steer
from the wheel in the bow after we get started, right down the coast.
We&#8217;ll lie to off Humber Island and eat supper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right, sir!&#8221; said Bates. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a good supper for
to-night, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Being right out on the water this way makes me hungry,&#8221; said
Eleanor. &#8220;That&#8217;s good news, Bates.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span><a id='link_12'></a>CHAPTER XII<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE TRAITOR</span></h2>

<p>The <i>Columbia</i> slowly and steadily made her way down the coast, keeping
within a mile or so of the shore. Speed was certainly not her long suit, but she
rode the choppy sea more easily than most boats so small would have done, and,
since she was not intended for speed, the usual traffic din of the motor was
absent. Altogether, she seemed an ideal pleasure boat.</p>

<p>As they went along, Trenwith pointed out the various places of interest along
the shore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Down this way we get to a part where a lot of rich men have built
summer homes,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You see there&#8217;s a good beach, and
they can buy enough land to have it to themselves. It&#8217;s pretty lonely, in
a way, because they&#8217;re a good long way from the railroad, but they
don&#8217;t seem to mind that.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>&#8220;I suppose
not. They&#8217;ve got money enough to keep all the automobiles and yachts they
want, so they wouldn&#8217;t use the railroad anyhow. I never would if I could
get around any other way.&#8221;</p>

<p>As they went on, the coast changed considerably from the familiar character
it had at Plum Beach. Cliffs took the place of the bluff, and while the beach
was still fine and level, there were rocky stretches at more and more frequent
intervals.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the nearest town in this direction?&#8221; asked
Eleanor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rock Haven,&#8221; said Trenwith. &#8220;That&#8217;s more of a place
than Bay City, because it&#8217;s quite a seaport. Up at Bay City, you see, we
don&#8217;t amount to much except in the summer time. But Rock Haven is a big
place, and most of the people who live there are there all the year round
instead of only for three months or so in the summer. You haven&#8217;t any idea
of what a dull old place Bay City is in winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s so dull, I shouldn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d stay
there.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>&#8220;Oh, it
was a good place for me to get a start, you know. I&#8217;ve been able to get
along in politics, and I&#8217;ve done better there than I would have in the
city, I suppose. And it&#8217;s all right for a bachelor, anyhow. He can always
get away. If I were married&#8211;well, it would be very different
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should think you&#8217;d like it much better in the city, though,
even if you are a bachelor. Why don&#8217;t you come there this
winter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps&#8211;I&#8217;d like&#8211;do you want me to come?&#8221;</p>

<p>He leaned forward, as if her answer were the most important thing in the
world, and, seeing Dolly&#8217;s mischievous glance at Bessie, Eleanor blushed
slightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it would be better for you to be in the city,&#8221; she said,
with dignity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll tell you a secret then&#8211;I&#8217;m really
bursting with a whole lot of others that I mustn&#8217;t tell. Charlie&#8217;s
been at me for months to come and be his partner, and I&#8217;ve promised to
think it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that would be splendid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad to hear you say so, because it <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span> really depends on you
whether I shall come or not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; she said, blushing again, and speaking in so low a tone
that only he could hear her. &#8220;You mustn&#8217;t talk like that
here&#8211;and now. It&#8211;it isn&#8217;t right.&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked helplessly at Dolly, and Trenwith, understanding, looked as if she
had said something that delighted him. Perhaps she had&#8211;perhaps she had
even meant to do so.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll attend to getting supper ready now, sir, Mr. Trenwith, if
you&#8217;ll take the wheel,&#8221; said Bates, just then.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; said Trenwith, nodding. &#8220;Now make a good job
of it, Bates. I&#8217;ve been praising you up to the skies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bates grinned widely, and disappeared.</p>

<p>No apologies were needed when they came to eat the supper which had been so
well heralded. A table was set up in the after part of the boat, and the awning
was drawn back so that the stars shone down on them. The <i>Columbia&#8217;s</i>
engine was <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
stopped, and she lay under the lee of Humber Island, a long, wooded islet that
sheltered them from the strong breeze, making the sea as smooth as a mill pond.
On shore twinkling lights began to appear, and, some distance away, a glare of
lights in the sky betrayed the location of Rock Haven.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this is lovely!&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;I&#8217;m so glad you
brought us here, Mr. Trenwith! But tell me, doesn&#8217;t anyone live on this
island? It&#8217;s so beautiful that I should think someone would surely have
built a summer home there long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe there are people there,&#8221; said Trenwith. &#8220;But
they are on the other side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry we have to go home, but I suppose we really must be
starting,&#8221; said Eleanor, after supper. &#8220;It&#8217;s such a heavenly
night that it seems to me it would be perfect just to stay here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wouldn&#8217;t it? But you&#8217;re right&#8211;we must be starting
back. We&#8217;ll go on and come around the other side of this island. You
should see it from <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
all points of view. Scenically, it&#8217;s our show place for this whole stretch
of coast.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so as soon as Bates had finished clearing off the table he went back to
his engine, and the <i>Columbia</i> slipped along smoothly in the shadow of the
island. But a few minutes later, as they were gliding along on the seaward side,
where the water was far rougher, there was a sudden jar, and the next moment the
engine stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, what&#8217;s the matter!&#8221; asked Eleanor, surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing much, probably,&#8221; said Trenwith &#8220;Bates will have it
fixed in a few minutes. The best engine in the world is apt to get balky at
times&#8211;and I must say that mine has chosen a very good time to
misbehave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor chose to ignore the meaning he so plainly implied, but she was
perfectly content with the explanation, and sat there dreamily, expecting to
hear the reassuring whir of the motor at any moment. But the minutes dragged
themselves out, and the only sound that came from the <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span> engine was the tapping of the tools
Bates was using. Trenwith frowned.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is very strange,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve never been
delayed as long as this since I&#8217;ve had Bates. He usually keeps the motor
in perfect running order. I&#8217;ll just step forward and see what&#8217;s
wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>He returned in a few moments, his face grave.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bates has some highly technical explanation of what is wrong,&#8221;
he said, seriously. &#8220;It seems that he needs some tools he hasn&#8217;t
got, in order to grind the valves. I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;ll have to get
ashore somehow&#8211;he seems to be sure that he can find what he is looking for
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor looked rather dismayed.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to make us terribly late in getting ashore,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;I&#8217;m afraid the others will be
worried about us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. Bates says that as soon as he gets the tools he wants he will have
things fixed up, and he&#8217;s quite certain that he can get them on the
island. He says anyone who has a motor boat <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_196'></a>196</span> will be able to help him out&#8211;and they
certainly couldn&#8217;t live here without one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how on earth are you going to get ashore if the engine won&#8217;t
work?&#8221; asked Dolly. &#8220;It seems to me that we&#8217;re stuck out
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you leave that to us!&#8221; said Trenwith, cheerfully.
&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry this has happened, but please believe me when I say that
it isn&#8217;t a bit serious.&#8221;</p>

<p>They soon saw the <i>Columbia</i> was to be rescued from her predicament. She
was fairly near the shore, and now Bates dropped an anchor, and she remained
still, swinging slowly on the chain.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll row ashore, you see, hunt up the people, and tell them
what he wants,&#8221; said Trenwith. &#8220;Hurry up, Bates! Remember,
we&#8217;ve promised to get these young ladies home in good time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right, sir,&#8221; said Bates, as he lowered the dinghy and dropped
into her. &#8220;Won&#8217;t take me long when I find the people on
shore&#8211;and about five minutes will fix that engine when I get back here
again.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>He rowed off
into the darkness, making for a point of light that showed on shore, and they
settled back to wait as patiently as they could for his return.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose Charlie turns up at the camp while we&#8217;re gone, and wants
you for something important?&#8221; asked Eleanor. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m afraid
we did wrong in coming!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it! Old Charlie will understand. And I know his plans
pretty well, so there isn&#8217;t any danger of this causing any
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>It seemed to take longer for Bates to find help than he had expected. At any
rate, the greater part of half an hour slipped away before they heard the sound
of oars coming toward them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, there are two men rowing!&#8221; said Dolly, curiously.
&#8220;And that dinghy only has room for one man with oars.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably they decided to send someone out with him to lend him a
hand,&#8221; said Trenwith. &#8220;People around these parts are pretty nice to
you if you have a breakdown, and I guess it&#8217;s <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span> partly because they never know when
they&#8217;re going to have one themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, that ought to make it easier to make the repairs that are
needed,&#8221; said Eleanor, somewhat relieved. &#8220;I really am getting
worried about what they&#8217;ll think at the beach. I&#8217;m afraid
they&#8217;ll be sure that something has happened to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good evening, Miss Mercer,&#8221; said a mocking voice behind her, and
she turned with a start to see Holmes!</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re late,&#8221; said Holmes, reproachfully. &#8220;I
expected you an hour earlier. But then better late than, never! Ah, I see both
of them are with you! Silas Weeks will be very glad to see you two, I have no
doubt!&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke then to Bessie and Zara, who, terrified by his sodden appearance,
were staring at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Trenwith!&#8221; said Eleanor, sharply. &#8220;You know who this
man is, do you not? And what our feelings are concerning him? Are you going to
let him stay here?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>&#8220;He has no
choice, Miss Mercer. Better not ask him too many questions about how you
happened to break down right off my island; he would have a hard time convincing
you with any story he told. Eh, Trenwith?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shut up!&#8221; growled Trenwith. &#8220;What does all this nonsense
mean? Get off my boat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, are you trying to make them believe you didn&#8217;t know about
this? I beg your pardon, Trenwith, I really do! Of course, Miss Mercer, he knows
as well as I do that I am within my rights. You are now in a state where certain
court orders applying to Bessie King and her little friend Zara ate
valid&#8211;and, knowing that these two girls, who have run away from the courts
of this state, are here, I have taken steps to see that they are taken into
court. I am a law abiding citizen&#8211;I do not like to see the law
insulted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor was dazed by the suddenness of the blow. To her it seemed an
accident; she could not believe that Trenwith could be guilty <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span> of such treachery as
Holmes was charging. But in a moment her faith in him was shattered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to help out your pose, Trenwith,&#8221; Holmes said to
him. &#8220;But I need you, so you&#8217;ll have to come off your perch.
You&#8217;ll have to come ashore with the others, in case you should change your
mind. I only want two of these girls, but the others will have to come, too, of
course, because if they got away they might make trouble. You shall be perfectly
comfortable, Miss Mercer, however.&#8221;</p>

<p>The look in Trenwith&#8217;s eyes, and the sheepish, hangdog expression of
his whole face made Eleanor gasp. So he had betrayed them! After all, despite
his fine talk, he had been tempted by the money that Holmes seemed prepared to
spend so lavishly! And he had led Bessie and Zara right into a trap&#8211;a
merciless trap, as she knew, from which escape would be most difficult, if not
utterly impossible.</p>

<p>And in a moment the lingering remnants of her <span class='pagenum

out, in a loud tone, at Bates:</p>

<p>&#8220;Bates!&#8221; he cried. &#8220;Come aboard and start that engine! Then
you can take your tub right up to the landing pier in front of the
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, yes!&#8221; said Bates. He sprang aboard, and a moment later the
engine, perfectly restored, was started, although nothing had been done to it
since Bates went ashore, and, the anchor lifted, the <i>Columbia</i> began her
brief voyage to the pier.</p>

<p>There had been no accident at all! The breakdown had been a deception, pure
and simple, intended to give Bates a chance to go ashore and warn Holmes that
his prey was within his reach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, how I despise you!&#8221; said Eleanor to Trenwith. &#8220;Go
away, please, so that I won&#8217;t have to look at you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Eleanor, listen!&#8221; he said, in a low whisper, pleadingly.
&#8220;I can explain&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think I&#8217;m such a fool as to believe anything you tell me
now,&#8221; she said, furiously, &#8220;you are very much mistaken!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>He saw that to
argue with her was hopeless, and went forward gloomily. In a few minutes they
were ashore. Resistance, as Eleanor saw, was hopeless; the only thing to do was
to act sensibly, and hope for a chance to escape.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have had three rooms arranged for you,&#8221; said Holmes, when they
reached a great rambling house. &#8220;They&#8217;re on the second floor. I
think you girls will be comfortable and you would rather, I am sure, have the
girls with you. You are in no danger.&#8221;</p>

<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span><a id='link_13'></a>CHAPTER XIII<br /><span class='h2fs'>A LUCKY MEETING</span></h2>

<p>Half a dozen men had come out to the <i>Columbia</i> with Holmes and Bates,
and now, while Holmes himself disappeared for a minute, beckoning to Trenwith to
go with him, the other men watched Eleanor and the three girls. They drew off to
a little distance, but they kept their eyes on them.</p>

<p>&#8220;They don&#8217;t look as if they could run very fast,&#8221; said
Dolly, hopefully. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you think we might be able to make a break
and get away?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where to, Dolly? This is an island, remember, and we don&#8217;t know
anything about it at all. We wouldn&#8217;t know where to run, if we did have
luck enough to get a good start&#8211;and we wouldn&#8217;t get very
far.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose that&#8217;s so,&#8221; said Dolly, her face falling.
&#8220;Oh, what a horrid shame! Just when everything seemed so nice and
peaceful!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_204'></a>204</span>&#8220;There&#8217;s one thing,&#8221; said Eleanor,
her face set and stern. &#8220;They can&#8217;t hold me forever&#8211;or, at
least, I don&#8217;t suppose they can. And someone is going to be sorry for this
or my name&#8217;s not Eleanor Mercer!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t understand it yet,&#8221; said Bessie, who, although the
capture meant more to her than it did to any of the others, had not given way to
her emotions, and seemed as cool and calm as if she had been safely back on Plum
Beach.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s only too easy to understand,&#8221; said Eleanor, bitterly.
&#8220;Charlie was deceived in his friend, Mr. Trenwith. He&#8217;s just as easy
to bribe as Jake Hoover. That&#8217;s all. He cares more for money and success
than he does for his reputation as an honorable man. I&#8217;m disappointed in
him&#8211;but I suppose I ought not to be surprised.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I <i>am</i> surprised,&#8221; said Dolly, defiantly. &#8220;And
I&#8217;m sure, somehow, that he&#8217;s all right. I think he was just as badly
fooled as the rest of us. Mr. Holmes probably wants us to think as badly <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span> of him as possible, so
that, if he should try to help us, we wouldn&#8217;t trust him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could believe that, Dolly. But the evidence against him is
too strong, I&#8217;m afraid. Hush, we mustn&#8217;t talk. Here is Mr. Holmes
coming back. I don&#8217;t want him to think that we&#8217;re afraid&#8211;it
would please him too much.&#8221;</p>

<p>With Mr. Holmes, as he came toward them, was a woman in servant&#8217;s garb,
middle aged, and sour in her appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;This woman will attend to you, Miss Mercer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She
will do whatever you tell her&#8211;unless it should happen to conflict with the
orders she has from me. But she won&#8217;t talk to you about me, or about this
place because she knows that if she does I will find out about it, and she will
have reason to regret it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m very much pleased by one thing, Mr. Holmes,&#8221; said
Eleanor. &#8220;You&#8217;ve shown yourself in your true colors at last. I
suppose you understand that when I get back to the city I shall see to it that
everyone knows the truth about you. I <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_206'></a>206</span> don&#8217;t think you will find yourself welcome in
the homes of any decent people after I tell what I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Miss Mercer,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Of course you
must do what you think best. But it really won&#8217;t do any good. I could do
things a great deal worse than this, and still, with the money I happen to have,
people would keep on fawning on me, and pestering me with their attentions and
their invitations as much as ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you&#8217;re right, but I intend to find out. May I ask how
long you intend to keep me here as a prisoner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are my guest, Miss Mercer, not my prisoner. Please don&#8217;t act
as if I were as great a villain as that. Losing your temper will not improve
matters in any way, you know&#8211;really it won&#8217;t. As for your question,
I think Bessie and Zara will be in the quite competent care of their old friend
Silas Weeks by noon to-morrow and then there will be no further reason for
keeping you here.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>&#8220;Then,
unless you are remarkably quick in getting out of the country, Mr. Holmes, you
ought to be under arrest for kidnapping by to-morrow night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Holmes laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, do let&#8217;s be friends!&#8221; he said. &#8220;You and your
friends have really given me a lot of trouble. But do I bear you any malice? Not
I! If you hadn&#8217;t taken care of those misguided girls after they ran away
from Hedgeville, none of this would have come about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you think you have some excuse for acting in this
fashion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly have, Miss Mercer. The very best. After all, why
shouldn&#8217;t I tell you! It&#8217;s too late for you to do me any harm
now&#8211;I have won the game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there will be a return match. Don&#8217;t forget that! My father
is as rich as you are, Mr. Holmes, and when he hears of the way I have been
treated, he will spend his last cent, if necessary, to get his revenge on
you.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>&#8220;Dear me,
I hope he won&#8217;t do anything so foolish, Miss Mercer! It would be a
dreadful waste of money&#8211;and he wouldn&#8217;t get it, in any case.
However, I don&#8217;t want you to be needlessly worried. Zara will soon be safe
with her father. She won&#8217;t have to stay very long with the estimable
Farmer Weeks. You know, I really don&#8217;t blame her for disliking
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zara gave a little cry of joy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Will I see my father? Is he well?&#8221; she cried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite well&#8211;but very obstinate,&#8221; said Holmes.
&#8220;That&#8217;s your fault, too, Miss Mercer. I&#8217;m sorry to say that
lately he has seemed to be inclined to listen to your cousin, Mr. Jamieson. He
is willing, you see, to deal with whoever happens to be in charge of his
daughter. He knows our friend Silas very well&#8211;too well, I think. And so,
when he knows that Zara is being looked after by him, I think he will be glad to
meet my terms, and so secure his freedom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You brute!&#8221; said Eleanor, hotly. &#8220;What are your
terms?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>&#8220;Ah, that
would be telling! You will have to wait to discover that. You see, Silas Weeks
wasn&#8217;t quite as stupid as the rest of the people at Hedgeville, and when
he couldn&#8217;t find out what old Slavin was doing there, he came to
me&#8211;because he thought I probably could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Slavin!&#8221; said Eleanor, in an amazed tone. &#8220;Is that your
father&#8217;s name, Zara? Why didn&#8217;t you tell us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He told me not to,&#8221; said Zara, nervously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Zara&#8217;s father had one bad fault; he wasn&#8217;t at all ready to
trust people,&#8221; Holmes went on, easily. &#8220;He didn&#8217;t even trust
me as he should have done, and he&#8217;s been positively insulting to Weeks.
It&#8217;s made a lot of trouble for him.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at his watch, then turned to the servant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go upstairs and make the rooms comfortable for Miss Mercer at
once,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s getting late.&#8221; Then he turned to
the men who had accompanied him to the <i>Columbia</i>. &#8220;It&#8217;s all
right, boys,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You needn&#8217;t wait.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>&#8220;These
people keep their ears entirely too wide open,&#8221; he explained to Eleanor.
&#8220;I have to be rather careful with them, though they probably
wouldn&#8217;t understand much if they did hear. Well, that is about all
I&#8217;ve got to tell you, anyhow. You see, you needn&#8217;t worry about your
friend Zara. As to Bessie&#8211;Well, that&#8217;s different.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at Bessie malevolently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think I care to tell you anything more about her,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;Weeks will look after her all right&#8211;as well as she
deserves to be looked after.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie seemed to be nervous as he looked at her, and edged away from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think you can keep Bessie in the care of that man Weeks,&#8221;
said Eleanor, &#8220;you are going to find yourself decidedly mistaken. He
won&#8217;t treat her properly, and if he doesn&#8217;t, the courts won&#8217;t
compel her to stay there. I know enough law for that, and I tell you now, that,
even though you may have some sort of law on your side just now, because you
have played this trick, you <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_211'></a>211</span> won&#8217;t be able to count on the law much
longer. It will be as powerful against you, properly used, as it has been for
you, improperly used.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Holmes laughed, unpleasantly. There was no mirth in the
laugh, only mockery and contempt. &#8220;Really, Miss Mercer&#8211;why, where
has that little baggage gone to?&#8221;</p>

<p>He stared wildly about the room, and Eleanor, startled, looked about her
also. Bessie had disappeared; vanished into thin air. In a rage, Holmes darted
here and there about the great hall of the house in which they had been
standing. But, though he looked behind curtains and all the larger pieces of
furniture, and made a great fuss, he found no sign of her. For a moment he was
completely baffled, and almost beside himself with rage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I always thought villains were clever,&#8221; said Dolly, as he stood
still. Her voice was scornful. &#8220;Why, even a girl like Bessie can fool you!
She&#8217;s done it plenty of times before now&#8211;you didn&#8217;t <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span> think you could keep her
from doing it this time, too, did you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean!&#8221; stormed Holmes, moving toward her, his hand
raised as if he meant to strike her. But if he thought he could frighten Dolly
he was much mistaken. She faced him calmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t make me tell you anything, even if you do hit
me,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And you won&#8217;t find Bessie, either, unless she
wants you to. I saw her go&#8211;but I&#8217;m not going to tell you how she
managed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not going to hit her,&#8221; yelled Holmes. &#8220;What
good would that do?&#8221;</p>

<p>He sprang to a bell, and pushed it violently. In a moment two or three of the
men he had dismissed, thus giving Bessie her chance to escape, answered his
summons, and he ordered them to start in search of her at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Find her, and you&#8217;ll be rewarded,&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;But
if you don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll make you pay for it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor had never seen a man in such a furious <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span> rage. It was plain that his plan,
successful as it seemed to be, was still in danger of being upset, and the
knowledge gave Eleanor new hope. It had seemed to her that, with Trenwith turned
traitor, there was not one chance in a million to foil Holmes this time. But now
everything was changed. He stayed with them only long enough to give them into
the keeping of the servant, who came down the stairs just as he finished giving
his orders to the men for the pursuit of Bessie.</p>

<p>&#8220;If any of them get out, I&#8217;ll know it&#8217;s your fault,&#8221;
he said to her. &#8220;And you know what I can do to you. You wouldn&#8217;t
like to go to jail for a few years, I guess. You will, if anyone else gets away
from this house to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he followed the men he had sent out in search of Bessie.</p>

<p>And all the time Bessie herself had heard every word, and seen every action
of the scene that followed the discovery of her escape. While Holmes was talking
to Eleanor she had seized the chance <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_214'></a>214</span> to slip over to a heavily curtained window, which,
she guessed, must open right on the ground.</p>

<p>She took the chance of it being open, and fortune favored her. Concealed by
the curtain, she was able to slip out, and then, instead of running as fast and
as far as she could, as nine people out of ten would have done, she stayed where
she was. She reasoned that there, so close to the house, was the last place
where search would be made.</p>

<p>And she was right. She saw Holmes dash from the room; she saw Eleanor and the
other girls being led upstairs. And then she not only heard, but saw the pursuit
of her that was begun. Men with lanterns searched the grounds; they looked
behind every bush. But, though a single glance, almost, would have revealed her
had anything like a careful search of the flower beds close to the house been
made, no one came near her hiding-place. Between her and the open garden was
only a flimsy screen of rose bushes, but it proved enough.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>She stayed
there, scarcely daring to breathe, while the men searched the grounds and the
beach. And she was still there, more than an hour later, when they returned,
tired and discouraged, to report the failure of their search to Holmes, who was
back in the room from which she had escaped.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fury!&#8221; cried Holmes. &#8220;She must be on the island!
There&#8217;s no way that she can have got away! Well, watch the boats! That
will have to do for to-night. She can&#8217;t get away without a boat&#8211;and
they are all in the boat-house. If she wanders down to the other end, to the
fort, we can catch her in the morning. They won&#8217;t believe any story she
can tell them, if she should happen to get there. And I don&#8217;t want to
disturb them to-night&#8211;I&#8217;d rather wait until morning, when they will
be over with the papers. I haven&#8217;t any real right to hold them to-night,
except the right of force.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie thrilled at the information those few words gave her. She remembered
now that there was a fort, manned by United States soldiers, on <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span> Humber Island. It was
one of the chain of forts that guarded the approaches to Rock Haven. And Bessie
had an idea that she would be able to find someone at the fort to believe her
story, wild and improbable as she knew it must sound. The great problem now was
to get out of the grounds unseen.</p>

<p>And that problem, of course, her cleverness in hiding so close to the house
had made much easier to solve. No one would suspect now that she was there; if
she waited until the house was quiet, and the men who were to watch the boats
had gone to their post, she should be able to steal out of the garden and in the
direction of the fort.</p>

<p>To be on the safe side, she waited nearly an hour longer. Then, as quietly as
she could, she began her solitary walk. Fortune, and her own ability to move
quietly, favored her. In five minutes she was out of the grounds, and in woods
where, though the walking was difficult, and she stumbled more than once, she at
least felt safe from the danger of pursuit.</p>

<p>Soon the woods began to thin; then they grew <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_217'></a>217</span> thicker again. But, after she had been walking, as
she guessed, for more than an hour, it grew lighter and she saw ahead of her the
outlines of dark buildings&#8211;Fort Humber, she was sure. And a minute later
the sharp hail of a sentry halted her, and at the same time made her sure that
she had not lost her way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who goes there?&#8221; called the sentry.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve lost my way,&#8221; said Bessie, trusting to her voice to
make him understand that she was not to be driven away. &#8220;Is this the fort?
I&#8217;d like to see some officer, if you please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait there! I&#8217;ll pass the word,&#8221; said the sentry.</p>

<p>And in a few minutes a young lieutenant came toward her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bless my soul!&#8221; he said, &#8220;What are you doing here, young
lady! Come with me&#8211;you can explain inside.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, once inside the fort, the first person she saw was Charlie Jamieson!</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span><a id='link_14'></a>CHAPTER XIV<br /><span class='h2fs'>AT THE FORT</span></h2>

<p>&#8220;Bessie King!&#8221; he exclaimed amazed. &#8220;What on earth, are you
doing here? And where is Trenwith?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; said Bessie. She felt safe and for a moment
she was on the verge of collapsing completely. But then she remembered that not
her own fate alone, but that of the others whom she loved and who had been so
good to her depended upon her. And, in a few quick words, she told the story of
the accident to the <i>Columbia</i>, with the treachery of Billy Trenwith and
the subsequent appearance of Holmes and his men.</p>

<p>&#8220;There you are, gentlemen!&#8221; said Jamieson, turning to the little
group of men in uniform, who, tremendously interested, had listened intently to
all that Bessie had said. &#8220;You laughed at me&#8211;you <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span> insisted that the sort
of thing I told you about wasn&#8217;t possible&#8211;that it simply
couldn&#8217;t happen in this country, and in this time. What do you think
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s one on us,&#8221; said one of the officers, with a
reluctant laugh. &#8220;But, really, Jamieson, you can&#8217;t blame us much,
can you? It&#8217;s pretty incredible, even now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m bothered about Trenwith, though,&#8221; said Charlie.
&#8220;Something has gone wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Miss Mercer is perfectly sure that he is in league with Mr.
Holmes,&#8221; said Bessie. &#8220;Do you think that&#8217;s so, Mr.
Jamieson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not,&#8221; said Charlie, soberly. &#8220;I&#8217;ve found out
one thing lately though, Bessie;&#8211;that when there is money involved, you
can never tell what is going to happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you know we were here&#8211;how did you fold out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No questions just now! It&#8217;s time something was being done. Tell
me, can you take me to this house, and show me how to get in!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>&#8220;Yes, I
think I can find my way back through the woods.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No need of that,&#8221; said one of the officers. &#8220;There&#8217;s
a road that leads right to that place. What&#8217;s Holmes doing there, anyhow?
It isn&#8217;t his place. It belongs to some people who bought it a little while
ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a Mr. and Mrs. Richards,&#8221; said Charlie. &#8220;But from
what Bessie here says, he seems to be doing about as he likes with it. Well, I
don&#8217;t want to waste any more time. Do you suppose I can see Colonel
Hart!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can unless your eyesight is failing,&#8221; said the Colonel,
appearing in the doorway. He had heard the question, and came forward smiling,
his hand outstretched. &#8220;How are you, Jamieson? What can I do for
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A great deal, if you will, Colonel,&#8221; said Charlie.
&#8220;I&#8217;d like to speak to you privately for a minute, if I
may&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shabby business&#8211;that&#8217;s what I call it,&#8221; said one of
the young officers. &#8220;He knows we&#8217;re wild <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span> to know what&#8217;s going on, and
there he goes off with the old man to tell him about it where we can&#8217;t
hear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then one of them happened to think that Bessie might be in need of
refreshment after her exciting experiences, and they waited on her as if she had
been a princess. By the time she had been able to convince them that she wanted
nothing more, Jamieson and the Colonel returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, my boy,&#8221; the colonel was saying. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
attend to it, and do as you wish. Maybe it isn&#8217;t strictly according to the
regulations, but I don&#8217;t believe anyone will ever file charges against me.
Depend upon me. You&#8217;re starting now!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jamieson. &#8220;Come along, Bessie. We&#8217;re
going back to the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m ready,&#8221; said Bessie, simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not afraid?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not as long as you&#8217;re there. I don&#8217;t believe Mr. Holmes
can do anything while you&#8217;re around.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hope he can&#8217;t, Bessie. But when they <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span> had managed to get away
as you did to-night, a whole lot of girls wouldn&#8217;t be in a hurry to run
into the same danger again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be very happy about getting away myself unless Zara
escaped, too, Mr. Jamieson. And I&#8217;m afraid of Mr. Holmes&#8211;I
don&#8217;t know what he might do if he were angry enough. I wouldn&#8217;t be
sure that Dolly and Miss Eleanor were safe with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, they are, Bessie. Of course, what I&#8217;m planning may go
wrong, but I feel pretty confident that we are going to give Mr. Holmes the
surprise of his life this night.&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked on steadily through the darkness, the going of course being much
easier than Bessie had found it in her flight, since she now had a good road
under her feet instead of the stumpy wood path, full of twisted roots and
unexpected bumps.</p>

<p>And at last a light showed through the trees to one side of the road, and
Bessie stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the place, I&#8217;m pretty sure,&#8221; she said. <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span> &#8220;I can tell for
certain, if we turn in, but I&#8217;m sure I didn&#8217;t pass another
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>So they went in, and a minute&#8217;s examination enabled Bessie to recognize
the grounds. She had had plenty of time to study them earlier in the night, when
she had crouched behind the rose bushes, expecting to be discovered and dragged
out every time one of the searchers passed near her.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I knew about Trenwith,&#8221; said Charlie, anxiously.
&#8220;That is one part of this night&#8217;s work that puzzles me. I
don&#8217;t understand it at all, and it worries me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He went off with Mr. Holmes after we got inside the house,&#8221; said
Bessie. &#8220;But I didn&#8217;t see him again after that. He wasn&#8217;t with
Mr. Holmes in the big hall again, after I had got away. I&#8217;m sure of
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you going to do now?&#8221; asked Bessie.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not certain. I&#8217;d like very much to know where the
other girls are. We ought to be all together.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>&#8220;Perhaps I
can find out,&#8221; said Bessie. &#8220;You stay here, and I&#8217;ll slip
along toward the house. If Dolly&#8217;s awake, I can find out where she
is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. But if you see anyone else, or if anyone interferes with
you, call me right away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie promised that she would, and then she slipped away, and a moment later
found herself in front of the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll try this side last,&#8221; she said to herself. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;d put them in front&#8211;more likely
they&#8217;d put them on the east side, because that only looks out over the
garden, and there&#8217;d be less chance of their seeing anyone who was
coming.&#8221;</p>

<p>So, moving stealthily and as silently as a cat, she went around to that side
of the house, and a moment later the strange, mournful call of a whip-poor-will
sounded in the still night air. It was repeated two or three times, but there
was no answer. Then Bessie changed her calling slightly.</p>

<p>At first she had imitated the bird perfectly. But this time there was a false
note in the call&#8211;just the slightest degree off the true pitch of the
bird&#8217;s <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span> note.
Most people would not have known the difference, but to a trained ear that
slight imperfection would be enough to reveal the fact that it was a human
throat that was responsible, and not a bird&#8217;s. And the trick served its
turn, for there was an instant answer. A window was opened above Bessie, very
gently, and she saw Dolly&#8217;s head peering down over the ivy that grew up
the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait there!&#8221; she whispered. &#8220;Get dressed, all three of
you! Mr. Jamieson is here&#8211;not far away. I&#8217;m going to tell him where
you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>She marked the location of the window carefully, and then, sure that she
would remember it when she returned, went back to Jamieson.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you locate them? Good work!&#8221; he said. &#8220;All right. Go
back now and tell them to make a rope of their sheets&#8211;good and strong. I
saw where you were standing, and, if they lower that, I don&#8217;t think we
will have any trouble getting up to their window. I want to be inside that
house&#8211;and I don&#8217;t want Holmes to know I&#8217;m there until <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span> I&#8217;m ready.&#8221;
He chuckled. &#8220;He thinks I&#8217;m back in the city. I want him to have a
real surprise when he finally does see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie slipped back then and told Dolly what to do, and in a few minutes the
rope of sheets came down, rustling against the ivy. Bessie made the signal she
had agreed on with Jamieson at once&#8211;a repetition of the bird&#8217;s call,
and he joined her. Then he picked her up and started her climbing up the wall,
with the aid of tie rope and the ivy.</p>

<p>For a girl as used to climbing trees as Bessie, it was a task of no great
difficulty, and in a minute she was safely inside the room, and had turned to
watch Jamieson following her. His greater weight made his task more difficult,
and twice those above had all they could do to repress screams of terror, for
the ivy gave way, and he seemed certain to fall.</p>

<p>But he was a trained athlete, and a skillful climber as well, and, difficult
as the ascent proved to be for him, he managed it, and clambered over <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span> the sill of the window
and into the room, breathless, but smiling and triumphant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re here, Charlie!&#8221; said Eleanor.
&#8220;There is someone we can trust, after all, isn&#8217;t there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, sure!&#8221; he said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you take on, Nell, and
don&#8217;t ask a lot of questions now. It&#8217;ll be daylight pretty
soon&#8211;and, believe me, when the light comes, there&#8217;s going to be
considerable excitement around these parts.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why did you bring Bessie back here? How did she find
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He raised his hand with a warning gesture, and smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember, Nell, no questions!&#8221; he said. &#8220;All we can do
just now is to wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>Wait they did&#8211;and in silence, save for an occasional whisper.</p>

<p>&#8220;That man Holmes has a woman guarding us,&#8221; whispered Eleanor.
&#8220;She is just outside the door in the hall&#8211;sleeping there. The idea
is to keep us from leaving these rooms. Evidently they never <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span> thought of our going by
the window. We did think of it, but we couldn&#8217;t see any use in it, because
we felt we wouldn&#8217;t know where to go on this island, even if we got
outside the grounds!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what he counted on, I guess,&#8221; answered Charlie.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you stayed. Cheer up, Nell! You&#8217;re going to have a
package of assorted surprises before you&#8217;re very much older!&#8221;</p>

<p>To the five of them, practically imprisoned, it seemed as if daylight would
never come. But at last a faint brightness showed through the window, and
gradually the objects in the room became more distinct. And, with the coming of
the light, there came also sounds of life in the house. The voices of men
sounded from the garden, and Charlie smiled.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll begin wondering about that rope and footprints under
this window pretty soon,&#8221; he said. &#8220;And I guess none of them will be
exactly anxious to tell Holmes, either.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was right, for in a few moments excited <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_230'></a>230</span> voices echoed from below, and then there was an
argument.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s got to be told,&#8221; said one man.
&#8220;It&#8217;s your job, Bill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose you do it yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Apparently, they finally agreed to go together. And five minutes later there
was a commotion outside the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s where I take cover!&#8221; whispered Charlie, with a
grin. And, just before the door was opened, and Holmes burst in, his face livid
with anger, the lawyer hid himself behind a closet door.</p>

<p>Holmes started at the sight of the four girls standing there, fully dressed,
his jaw dropping.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you&#8217;re all here?&#8221; he said, an expression of relief
gradually succeeding his consternation. &#8220;Found you couldn&#8217;t get
away, eh, Bessie? Why didn&#8217;t you come to the front door instead of
climbing in that way? We&#8217;d have let you in all right.&#8221; He laughed,
harshly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;ve had about all the trouble you&#8217;re going to give
me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Silas Weeks will be <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_231'></a>231</span> here to take care of you pretty soon, my girl, and
now that he&#8217;s got you in the state where you belong, I guess you
won&#8217;t get away again very soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What state do you think this island is in!&#8221; asked Charlie
Jamieson, appearing suddenly from his hiding-place.</p>

<p>Holmes staggered back. For a moment he seemed speechless. Then he found his
tongue.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing here? How did you get into my house?&#8221; he
snarled. &#8220;I&#8217;ll have you arrested as a burglar.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, no, you won&#8217;t,&#8221; said Charlie, pleasantly. &#8220;But
I&#8217;m going to have you arrested&#8211;for kidnapping. Answer my
question&#8211;do you think this is in the state where the courts have put
Bessie in charge of Silas Weeks?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly it is,&#8221; said Holmes, blustering.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to keep up with the news better, Mr. Holmes. The United
States Government has bought this island for military purposes. It&#8217;s a
Federal reservation now, and the writ of the state <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span> courts has no value whatever. Even the
land this house stands on belongs to the government now&#8211;it was taken by
condemnation proceedings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor gave a glad cry at the good news. At last she understood the trap
into which Holmes had fallen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look outside&#8211;look through the window!&#8221; said Jamieson.</p>

<p>Holmes rushed to the window, and his teeth showed in a snarl at what he
saw.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t get away, you see,&#8221; said Jamieson. &#8220;There
isn&#8217;t any sentiment about those soldiers. They&#8217;d shoot you if you
tried to run through them. I&#8217;d advise you to take things easily.
There&#8217;ll be a United States marshal to take you in charge pretty soon.
He&#8217;s on his way from Rock Haven now. He&#8217;ll probably come on the same
boat that brings Silas Weeks&#8211;and some other people you are not
expecting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Holmes slumped into a chair. Defeat was written in his features. But he
pulled himself together presently.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_233'></a>233</span>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got the upper hand right
now,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But what good does it do you? I&#8217;m the only one
who knows the truth, and the reason for all this. They won&#8217;t do anything
to me&#8211;they can&#8217;t prove any kidnapping charge. The boat was
disabled&#8211;I entertained these girls over night when they were stranded
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see about that,&#8221; said Jamieson, quietly. &#8220;And
I may know more than you think I&#8217;ve been finding out a few things since
the talk I had with Jake Hoover in Bay City yesterday. Did you know that he was
arrested the day before yesterday at Plum Beach?&#8221;</p>

<p>Evidently Holmes had not known it. The news was a fresh shock to him. But he
was determined not to admit defeat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much good he&#8217;ll do you!&#8221; he said. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t
know anything&#8211;even if he thinks he does.&#8221;</p>

<hr class='pb' />
<h2><a id='link_15'></a>CHAPTER XV<br /><span class='h2fs'>THE MYSTERY SOLVED</span></h2>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and, in answer to Jamieson&#8217;s call to
come in, one of the young officers Bessie had seen at the fort entered. He
smiled cheerfully at Bessie, saluted the other girls, and grinned at
Jamieson.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve herded all the people we found around the place down in
the boat-house,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They were too scared to do anything. Is
this your man Holmes?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You guessed right the very first time, Lieutenant,&#8221; said
Charlie. &#8220;Any sign of that boat from Rock Haven?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s just coming in,&#8221; said the officer. &#8220;She ought
to land her passengers at the pier in about ten minutes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s time to go down to meet her,&#8221; said Charlie.
&#8220;Come on, girls, and you too, Holmes. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_234'></a>234</span> You&#8217;ll be needed down there. And I guess
you&#8217;ll find it worth your while to come, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Holmes, protesting, had no alternative, and in sullen silence he was one of
the little group that now made its way toward the pier. She was just being tied
up as they arrived, and Silas Weeks, his face full of malign triumph at the
sight of Bessie and Zara, was the first to step ashore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Got yer, have I?&#8221; he said. He turned to a lanky, angular man who
was at his side. &#8220;There y&#8217;are, constable,&#8221; he said.
&#8220;There&#8217;s yer parties&#8211;them two girls there! Arrest them, will
yer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not here, I won&#8217;t,&#8221; said the constable. &#8220;You
didn&#8217;t tell me it was to come off here. This is government land&#8211;I
ain&#8217;t got no authority here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You keep your mouth shut and your eyes and ears open, Weeks,&#8221;
said Jamieson, before the angry old farmer could say anything. Then he stepped
forward to greet a man and woman who had followed Weeks down the gangplank.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re here, Mrs. Richards, and you <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span> too, Mr.
Richards,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be able to keep my
promise.&#8221;</p>

<p>Holmes was staring at Mrs. Richards and her husband in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You here, Elizabeth?&#8221; he exclaimed. &#8220;And Henry, too? I
didn&#8217;t know you were coming!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We decided to come quite unexpectedly, Morton,&#8221; said the lady,
quietly. She was a woman of perhaps forty-two or three, tall and distinguished
in her appearance. But, like her husband, her face showed traces of privations
and hardship.</p>

<p>Behind them came a stiff, soldierly looking man, in a blue suit, and him
Jamieson greeted with a smile and handshake.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s your man, marshal,&#8221; he said, pointing to Holmes.
&#8220;I guess he won&#8217;t make any resistance.&#8221;</p>

<p>And, while Mr. and Mrs. Richards stared in astonishment, and Weeks turned
purple, the marshal laid his hand on the merchant&#8217;s shoulder, and put him
under arrest. Holmes was trapped at last.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span>&#8220;What does
this mean?&#8221; Mrs. Richards asked, indignantly. &#8220;What are you doing to
my brother, Mr. Jamieson?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s quite a long story, Mrs. Richards,&#8221; he answered,
easily. &#8220;And, strange as it may seem, I&#8217;ll have to answer it by
asking you and your husband some questions that may seem very personal. But
I&#8217;ve made good with you so far, and I can assure you that you will have no
cause to regret answering me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Richards bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place, you and your husband have been away from this part
of the country for quite a long time, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. For a number of years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you have not always been as well off, financially, as you are
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is quite true. My husband, shortly after our marriage, failed in
business, owing&#8211;owing to conditions he couldn&#8217;t control.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it true, Mrs. Richards, that those conditions were the
result of his marriage to you? <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_237'></a>237</span> Didn&#8217;t your father, a very rich man, resent
your marriage so deeply that he tried to ruin your husband in order to force you
to leave him?&#8221;</p>

<p>There were tears in the woman&#8217;s eyes as she nodded her head in
answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. I know this is very painful&#8211;but I must really do all
this. You refused to leave your husband, however, and when he decided to go to
Alaska, you went with him?</p>

<p>&#8220;And there he made a lucky strike, some four or five years ago, that
made him far richer than he had ever dreamed of becoming?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is quite true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, although you were rich, you did not come home? You spent a good
deal of time in the Far North, and when you went out for a rest, you came no
further east than Seattle or San Francisco?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There was no reason for us to come here. All our friends had turned
against us in our misfortunes, and our only child was dead. So it was only a few
months ago that we came home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is very tragic. Thank you, Mrs. Richards. <span class='pagenum
pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span> One moment&#8211;I have another
question to ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>He stepped toward the gangplank.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will be back in a moment,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>He went on board the boat, and while all those on the dock, puzzled and
mystified by his questions, waited, he disappeared. When he returned he was not
alone. A woman was with him, and, at the sight of her Bessie gave a cry of
astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, Mrs. Richards,&#8221; said Charlie. &#8220;Have you ever seen
this woman before?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I have,&#8221; she said, in a strange, puzzled tone.
&#8220;But&#8211;she has changed so&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her name is Mrs. Hoover, Mrs. Richards. Does that help you to
remember?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Mrs. Richards sobbed and burst into tears. &#8220;Mrs.
Hoover!&#8221; she said, brokenly. &#8220;To think that I could forget you! Tell
me&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One moment,&#8221; said Charlie, interrupting. His own voice was not
very steady, and Eleanor, a look of dawning understanding in her eyes, was <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span> staring at him, greatly
moved. &#8220;It was with Mrs. Hoover that you left your child when you went
west under an assumed name, was it not? It was she who told you that she had
died?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I lied to you&#8211;I lied to you!&#8221; wailed Maw Hoover,
breaking down suddenly, and throwing herself at the feet of Mrs. Richards.
&#8220;She wasn&#8217;t dead. It was that wicked Mr. Holmes and Farmer Weeks who
made me say she was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; thundered Richards. &#8220;She isn&#8217;t dead? Where is
she?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bessie!&#8221; said Charlie, calling to her sharply. &#8220;Here is
your daughter, Mrs. Richards, and a daughter to be proud of!&#8221;</p>

<p>And the next moment Bessie, Bessie King, the waif no longer, but Bessie
Richards, was in her mother&#8217;s arms!</p>

<p>&#8220;So Mr. Holmes was Bessie&#8217;s uncle!&#8221; said Eleanor, amazed.
&#8220;But why did he act so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can explain that,&#8221; said Charlie, sternly. &#8220;It was he who
set his father so strongly against his sister&#8217;s marriage to Mr. Richards.
He expected <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span> that
he would inherit, as a result, her share of his father&#8217;s estate, as well
as his own. But his plans miscarried. Mrs. Richards and her husband had
disappeared before her father&#8217;s death, and, when he softened and was
inclined to relent, he could not find them. But he knew they had a daughter, and
he left to her his daughter&#8217;s share of his fortune&#8211;over a million
dollars. There was no trace of the child, however, and so there was a provision
in the will that if she did not come forward to claim the money on her
eighteenth birthday it should go to her uncle&#8211;to Holmes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I always said it was money that was making him act that way!&#8221;
cried Dolly Ransom.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Jamieson. &#8220;He had squandered much of his own
money&#8211;he wanted to make sure of getting Bessie&#8217;s fortune for
himself. So when he learned through Silas Weeks where the child was, he paid
Mrs. Hoover to tell her parents she was dead, and then, after she had run away,
he and Weeks did all they could to get her back to a place where there was no
chance of anyone finding <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_241'></a>241</span> out who she was. They nearly succeeded&#8211;but I
have been able to block their plans. And one reason is that they were greedy and
they couldn&#8217;t let Zara Slavin and her father alone. He is a great inventor
and they profited by his ignorance of American customs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only found out her name last night,&#8221; said Eleanor. &#8220;I
wondered if he could be the Slavin who invented the new wireless
telephone&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They got him into jail on a trumped-up charge,&#8221; said Charlie.
&#8220;And then they tried to keep Zara away from people who might learn the
truth from her, and offer to supply the money he needed. In a little while they
would have robbed him of all the profits of his invention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll finance it myself,&#8221; said Richards, &#8220;and he can
keep all of the profit.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bessie&#8217;s father and mother were far too glad to get her back to want to
punish Ma Hoover, who was sincerely repentant. They could hardly find words
enough to thank Eleanor and Dolly for <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_242'></a>242</span> their friendship, and to Charlie Jamieson their
gratitude was unbounded.</p>

<p>But suddenly, even while the talk was at its height, there was a diversion.
Billy Trenwith, his clothes torn, his hands chafed and bleeding, appeared on the
dock.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good Heavens, Billy, I&#8217;d forgotten all about you!&#8221; said
Charlie. &#8220;Where have you been?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you speak to him as a friend after the way he betrayed
us?&#8221; asked Eleanor, indignantly, and Billy winced. But Charlie laughed
happily.</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t betray you,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I cooked up this
whole thing, just to catch Holmes red-handed, and he walked right into the trap.
I told Billy not to tell you, because I wanted you to act so that Holmes
wouldn&#8217;t know it was a trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He didn&#8217;t trust me, though,&#8221; said Billy, ruefully.
&#8220;As soon as he had the girls, he tied me up and chucked me into his cellar
so that I couldn&#8217;t change my mind, he said. That&#8217;s why I
didn&#8217;t meet you at the fort.&#8221;</p>

<p>Eleanor, shamefaced and miserable, looked at <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_243'></a>243</span> him. Then, with tears in her eyes, she held out her
hand to him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you ever forgive me?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;You bet I can!&#8221; he shouted. &#8220;Why, you were meant to think
just what you did! There&#8217;s nothing to forgive!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to have known you couldn&#8217;t do a mean, treacherous
thing,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;All&#8217;s well that ends well,&#8221; said Charlie, gaily.
&#8220;Now as to your brother, Mrs. Richards? I don&#8217;t suppose you want him
arrested?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8211;oh, no!&#8221; said she, looking at Holmes
contemptuously.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then, if you&#8217;ll withdraw the charge of kidnapping, Eleanor, he
can go.&#8221;</p>

<p>And the next moment Holmes, free but disgraced, slunk away, and out of the
lives of those he had so cruelly wronged.</p>

<hr class='tb' />

<p>Sunset of that day found them all back at Plum Beach, where the Camp Fire
Girls, who had been almost frantic at their long absence, greeted them <span
class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span> with delight. The story
of Bessie&#8217;s restoration to her parents, and of the good fortune that was
soon to be Zara&#8217;s, seemed to delight the other girls as much as if they
themselves were the lucky ones, and Gladys Cooper, completely restored to
health, was the first to kiss Bessie and wish her joy.</p>

<p>And after dinner Eleanor, blushing, rose to make a little speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, girls,&#8221; she said, &#8220;Margery Burton is to be a
Torch-Bearer as soon as we get back to the city. And you are going to need a new
Guardian soon. She will be chosen&#8211;and she will make a better one than I
have been, I think.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a chorus of astonished cries.</p>

<p>&#8220;But why are you going to stop being Guardian, Miss Eleanor?&#8221;
asked Margery.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because&#8211;because&#8211;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you why,&#8221; said Billy Trenwith, leaping up and
standing beside her. &#8220;It&#8217;s because she&#8217;s going to be married
to me!&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a moment of astonished silence. <span class='pagenum pncolor'><a
id='page_245'></a>245</span> And then, from every girl there burst out, without
signal, the words of the Camp Fire song:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wo-he-lo&#8211;wo-he-lo&#8211;wo he-lo&#8211;Wo-he-lo for
Love!&#8221;</p>
